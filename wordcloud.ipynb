That is such a huge topic, and as everyone has a life-long relationship to their health and others' health, I mean, I was a caretaker through my 20s and I've spent a lot of time hospitals and alternative care clinics, so have a lot of experience, not as a sick person, but in relation to sickness, and also mental illness, in which I've taken care of people also, so, I don't know, I think right now... My wellbeing is kind of situated relationally because I care for people, so a lot of times it's just navigating the boundaries between taking on other people's pain and knowing how to negotiate my limits within that.\n",

I don't know if you lean your heads out of your windows at 7:00 o'clock and hear the clap for the healthcare workers that happens, or the essential workers that happens at 7:00 o'clock, which is amazing and such an incredible thing for me to be able to share with my son as well who's only three and a half months old, but is something that even he can appreciate.\n",

If out of that, will be some movement, like you said, to help create connections and access. And what a healthy New York would look like, I don't know, I mean Staten Island is the one borough without a public hospital. The local hospital that's near where I live is, I'm not going to... we'll go off the record on that, because it's a disaster. And then there's another hospital. But that should not be considered the center source of health. There's so many other things like the parks and all the social determinants that really impact it.

I read somewhere recently that I that I think is maybe, is relevant here, that this moment gives us the chance to really interrogate everything that we've taken for granted. And so what you're talking about in terms of just something like telemedicine. Just a kind of inside thing that I know, because of the work that I do, and maybe you guys see this in your work is, one of the biggest barriers to telemedicine was the way that people get reimbursed by Medicaid, or the way that doctors get reimbursed by Medicaid. And so they didn't have a financial interest to do that.\n",

      "Okay. Gracias, Marta, por ser fuerte y llorar, porque las personas que lloran demuestran fortaleza. Quiero responder a la pregunta. Yo he aprendido la resistencia. He aprendido a luchar y pelear en forma organizada, a ver que hay que seguir las reglas, porque si no seguimos las reglas no se puede trabajar en comunidad. He aprendido que, como mamá, tenemos que poner el hombro para que esto salga adelante y no tenemos que tenerle miedo a las cosas que vienen. He aprendido que Dios tiene el control de todo esto, y que nosotros no tenemos que irnos para atrás, sino ir para adelante y dar la cara para todo lo que venga. Como, por ejemplo, este reto que fue el corona. Yo digo que fue el corona porque ya lo estamos ganando, y eso con toda la tecnología que no existía en los tiempos pasados, ha venido ahora a salvar la vida de las personas, porque las medicinas antiguas son lo que realmente han salvado a la gente. Para mí, mucha gente que ha estado en la casa se ha curado y mucha gente que ha ido al hospital ha muerto. Entonces, hay que tener fe en los conocimientos que tenían nuestros padres, nuestros ancestros. También he aprendido que el tiempo que nosotros podemos dar tiene mucho valor, porque hay mucha gente que te llama y te pide una ayuda en un tiempo que no es según el tiempo, pero uno ya no pone tiempo a eso cuando las cosas pasan, porque no interesa. Es un tiempo voluntario que tú tienes que darlo y que lo das con amor, porque así podemos ayudar a mucha gente. He aprendido que se puede hacer un plato de comida más para darle a un vecino, para darle a un amigo, para darle al que realmente lo necesita, y que eso te llena el corazón y que estás haciendo algo bueno, positivo, por la gente y por nuestra comunidad que lo necesita. Todo eso. He aprendido mucho a ser más solidaria con todos, a ser humilde, y que lo de afuera no interesa, sino lo que tiene uno adentro en el corazón. Gracias.\n",

So I see that as something that's very useful and beneficial to families in Brooklyn. And oftentimes, when we have students that we do referrals for, for mental health services or families that we do referrals for, they usually don't go because of whatever fears they have, or because of the scheduling.

You can go in and either get the antibody test done or the actual COVID to see if you currently have it.

In terms of healthcare, I do agree with what Mikey said, that prior to the start of the pandemic, things were much easier to get access to. You could just pop into a doctor's office and if you needed answers, you could hopefully get them then or in the week, but now things are being so pushed back.

So hopefully there are virtual meetings and stuff like that, as far as they can go, because there's so many limitations that they allow us to even...

But at 26, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition called systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, so up until 25, it was just very basic yearly checkup, everything was fine, and then after 26, when I got diagnosed with that, it was like, I was seeing all the 'ologists in the book.

My condition is an autoimmune condition, and so I take immunosuppressants, so that means I was also... I'm at higher risk. And so that created a whole slew of anxieties for me. But yeah, it's just been an interesting rollercoaster then. So all my appointments were canceled, and so as a patient, I was hoping, \"All right, well, this'll be a great way for me to connect with my doctors more on a one on one basis,\" and I didn't get that.

I was having aches and pains and I was in my early 20s, I was like, \"I shouldn't feel like this.\" And finally my aunt was like, \"Come to my doctor's office where I work.\" And I did all these tests regarding food allergies, and I ended up having some food allergies, and it took me a really long time, from 2012 to 2015.

But it kind of goes to show how having a sense of community, regardless of what that is, really unites people and how important it is for those different communities to be able to work together to offer opportunities for people, whether it be access to healthcare or just making us feel safe and secure.

You're very open to sharing your story. And growing up in the Guyanese community, it's very frowned upon to talk about your mental health. It's like, if you have mental issues or you're unstable, people look at you as you're crazy and you should go into a psychiatric facility. It's that bad.

But what's still top of my head is this idea of initiating conversations about mental health within our culture. Me from Caribbean descent, the only thing that I heard in regards to mental health was streams. Like it was either someone drinking poison, and I'm telling the words that they'll use, or hanging themselves. And there was no aspect of treatment or no discussion exploring things. So how do we initiative these within our familial structure, which then transcribes to bigger communities, like extended family, extended family then becomes this community setting?

And I've been able to process a lot on my own, but you can't do it all, right?\n",

I had pneumonia, I was in the hospital for seven days and my lungs were filled with liquid. And before that I had gained a whole lot of weight and I was at my biggest that I ever been in my life. And so for me, it was like, I need to take control back of my life because I'm such a giver and I'm always giving to everyone. And I had not taken time to really process who I was and I didn't realize how depressed I was. And so I really started a journey of really trying to get to one, know myself and then two, also just get to the layer of why I had gained so much weight.\n",

And then that comes from, immigrant parents who come from a different country and they may not know, maybe didn't have access to that and how to use that.

We were talking about why don't we have a Trader Joe's, why we don't have a Stewart Leonard. Why don't we have those supermarkets? So for me, it's one of those things where it's true. We talk about health and this microcosm of we need better doctors in healthcare, but it starts with what we put in our body. I talked about how I weighed so much and things like that.

It's still a struggle when you come out if you ain't got fully the health or the mental that you need. There should be other options instead of just sending them out, putting them on medication. Because really, all the medication's doing is, it's drugging you up. You're walking around in a daze and you ain't really ready yet. You should be where you make sure that they're really ready, to know where they're going to get the right help. Because down on Rikers Island, there's no help for anyone who has mental illness.

And that we're giving folks an opportunity to address violence and harm in their communities, but we have to resource that. It's not as simple as people just going out and having conversations. Often that requires space. You need space for people to come, and to process and have those conversations. You need to provide resources like food or childcare when people don't want to bring their children into those restorative justice spaces to talk about what's happening in their family to shield them from any of that trauma while they're working through it. That means feeding the kids when they're being supervised by somebody else, and paying that person who is using their time and energy to support that family.\n",

And speaking to the right people, just going back to what Simone said, you have to find someone who is empathetic because people will listen and move on. Okay, they have problems, but you have to find someone in the community, a leader who is a champion, who can be or champion and who can bring it to a place where we can get the help we need.

A lot of them, they went through the trauma, they were the ones that lost family members, they were the ones that had family members dying in the hospital and weren't able to be there and to have closure and even have the ability to bury their loved ones. Yet what I saw and what was profound to me was the amount of outpouring of love that the community showed to us, the healthcare providers, over the past couple of months, it was heartwarming.\n",

We saw that through people gathering together to help out with the homeless, making sure that they were safe during the riots, making sure that they had a shelter, someplace to stay at. Unfortunately, my household was hit with COVID-19 twice. My husband worked at Montefiore Hospital in Mount Vernon and he is one of the security guys there and he had it back to back. When he got it the first time, we could not get any services. We didn't drive, so we couldn't go to a drive-thru. And it took maybe up to six weeks before we found out that he was absolutely COVID-19 positive. We have five kids, there was nothing put in place at the time for us to be able to split away from our children. Our children are ages from six to 17 years old.

Going to the supermarket, is there a line? Oh, no there's no line. Okay wonderful I have to go in, but then you walk and you see, \"Okay, how many people are in the aisle?

And if we can do away with that where everyone gets the same quality help, whether it's accessibility to food, and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals, across the board, that if I'm walking down Corona, my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan.

It's something that is still institutionalized that if there really is something where people are saying, \"Oh you know,\" the politician's like, \"Oh, that community, they'll be okay, they can buy their own,\" but they can't buy their own because there are no jobs in the neighborhood so they can't have enough excess income so that they can spend extra money on something like a mask, or getting healthy foods and things like that.\n",

      "So if you think about who people listen to. Who are the parents listening to? Who are the children, the little ones listen to the parents, but as they get older and they become more independent, the middle school, high school years and so on, they're listening to voices in the media. They're listening to their artists and their comedians and actors and sports figures and so it's not enough for the parents to be educated. It's not enough for them to learn about it in school. Because like you were saying, Vilma, some people don't believe that there is a pandemic. I've heard on more than one occasion a friend or relative talking about some report they read from a reliable source on the internet, someone who's part of the government, they're part of the military and they know what's going on. So you hear these conspiracy theories about the government trying to get rid of us, saying they don't trust the medical community, they'd rather listen to their friends and so on, and that's a big problem.\n",

What I think really needs to happen, it's not just one person's job, the school can't do it alone, because children leave the school and go home to parents. They come back the next day. They're influenced by what's happened at home and that influences what they take in, willing and able to take in in school. I really think that more public figures in the [inaudible] government, I don't even mean the medical community.

It's just entertainment. It's making people feel good. So the people that you're listening to need to be speaking up and telling you, \"Wear a mask,\" need to echo what the medical community is saying about what this virus really is. What's happening, not just on your block, because a lot of people only understand what's happening on their block.

So I'm going to take away from here, from this conversation is, that as a community we have to continue to empower each other and to make sure that within our community we have what it takes to survive, so that way we don't have to leave our community to find and to satisfy our needs. To be able to educate. If you know something that is going to be important and is going to improve your neighbor, your family, your co-worker, share it. Again, if you're living in a community that you have the resources that are going to help you survive, all you need is to give your neighbors that referral and say, \"Hey, go down on that street. They have the best fruit market,\" or, \"You know what, there's a doctor two blocks down. He is the best dermatologist.\"\n",

When it comes to healthcare, I just want to say that I'm appreciative of all the different organizations that have come together to actually help us fight this whole pandemic that we're going through. The many donations that we've received from these people are what's helping us to keep going and to keep fighting, and it helps us to be resilient.

And if we can do away with that where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals, across the board, that if I'm walking down Corona in my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan.

It's not that people can't determine their own quality of life, that it's seen through an ableist perspective of, \"Oh, they can walk, they can bathe themselves, they can work,\" as if a person has more value, deserves more of these life-saving treatments if they can earn 80,000, 100,000, 200,000 dollars.

I was talking to a friend who went to Stanford Medical School, and she said you don't learn at the top medical schools in the country. I was discouraged from going to medical school because of my vision, because I was told that I couldn't take pulses. So if they're pushing us away from pursuing medical careers and then they don't even take an effort to understand us, then how are they going to help us?\n",

      "Hi, my name is Marybeth and I grew up in Springfield, Mass. Went to school in Boston, moved to New York, and I've been here a long time. New normals, I guess, if you will. I had a Pilates and personal training business that expanded into Reiki and Medical Qigong for a long time. Well, just got bit by a bug in 2010 and in 2017 I had brain surgery, and I've learned so much about that and I really want to bridge the gap and help people, and understand what the best effective way is to reach someone, if you will. Not reach them about my point but just be able to hear and let them feel safe. So they can express and I can express. But I love what you said in the beginning. Thanks.\n",

And then just, \"Here, Universe. I'm available, barring terrorism and barring no one losing their money on this trip, to not go.\" And then I came back, and two weeks later I woke up in the hospital and I had West Nile encephalitis. And I started, unannounced to me, having some clinical seizures that weren't discovered until 2015. I still maintained a business, and I even had a GoFundMe page. It was unfortunate that I wasn't explained...people advocating for me had exceeded my time frame. And all the meds started making my communication a little awkward. So the times I felt best was when I was effectively able to communicate in a way that allowed me to help people. So, that's that. I think that's probably enough.\n",

I was put in a hospital and they had me on EEG for a week. I went in by myself, I think my boyfriend came once and stayed over, they had me a nice place. But clearly, you could see. I would go out to the hall because they'd forget to bring my lunch, and I'd just be like, \"I'm hungry.\" Not demanding. And I could see them sitting at a desk, I called it Grey's Anatomy.

And the doctor happened to come in and mention that, \"Oh, we went in there, we didn't get anything.\" Everything. The only reason I got help, it took a year for me to get me help I needed. I should've gone into inpatient. Not because I'm any race, gender, just because I'm a human and the only way that I got attention was... I grew up with three older brothers, Irish, sarcasm thrown back and forth so I guess it could be in my nature.

Just those things, that's how I relate and I don't want to be negative, I'm very lucky. So I want to do something with it. That said, it's resonated with me, I'm sorry.

And no one has ever brought, and she's probably been displaying these actions the whole time. And no one's ever made that connection.

And so I don't know what kind of to do with that around, having a credible messenger onsite, we've talked forever around staffing.

I think there's a lot that our healthcare professionals can learn from the people that they're serving. And that's what I'd really suggest is that they start doing some focus groups. If you're a healthcare provider or a huge hospital, or a provider that's serving a lot of folks coming home from jail and prison, then you need to start having some conversations with us. And you all need to start changing your policies a little bit more to reflect what's going to work, because we're the population you're working with, right?\n",

      "Thank you. I'll just jump in just to reinforce everything that you all have been saying about the mental health system. So while my family is not just as affected, definitely mentally health impacted. My sister had serious mental health issues and committed suicide 10 years ago, 11 years ago. And she had like a psychotic break in New York city where she was hospitalized for two weeks. And then they said she was fine. And the option was either go to this like day treatment program for substance abuse. And people really had a cognitive level that was much different than my sister's.\n",

I think that is part of being healthy is knowing that if there is something that's done, that's wrong, that you have the avenue to appeal to whatever, right. That there's some accountability measure and that you have access to enforce that accountability. And that's something I think justice impacted people for a long time. And this might be part of the reason why the healthcare system hasn't changed compared to so many other systems that are in the process at least with changing, is we're so happy to just have any kind of like ... At my worst, I was just happy to have a couch to sleep on or a floor to sleep on somewhere. And so we get used to expecting, and this kind of goes back to self care, we don't get used to expecting a lot.\n",

Yes, there's the negative aspect to it, that I'm not as good with self care and need to really focus on my health also. But I can usually accomplish more than most of the general population because a lot of people were manic. Steve jobs was manic, dammit. It's I think getting folks to understand and see that like, just because we have a mental health diagnosis does not mean we're illiterate or incompetent or unable to understand. I hate when doctors talk to me like I'm in kindergarten. Turn the computer on, like you can have IT departments talk to you. But I feel like they were doctors sometimes, it's like some of the questions they ask, I'm like, \"Am I in kindergarten? I'm not five years old. Treat us like we're human beings too.

      "There's just so many things, I think there's so much judgment on folks, and there's so much misinformation and lack of education and just plain ignorance, especially with the healthcare field, that we have a lot more work to do in this society. And a true Healthy NYC I think breaks down all of those barriers. It really empowers people. We really look at the strengths that folks have and then help them get into opportunities that they need, so they can actually get those careers and not just stay in minimum wage jobs, right. And all of that, I think employment is very tied to your health and wellness also. And if we really want to talk about this integrated holistic system, Piper, employment has got to be tied to that too with housing.\n",
