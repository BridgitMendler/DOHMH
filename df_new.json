{"snips": {"0": "Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I've begun recording at this time and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation.", "1": "Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Secondly, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another, and thirdly, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we'll uplift the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers, and members of the media.", "2": "To this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you're invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and well-being of your community rather than sharing any personal health information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project, at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "3": "As a participant in this conversation you're providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording according to its mission of fostering conversation in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website or be broadcast on a local radio station or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media, so please share only what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\" And I'll go in the order of the people of the people on my screen so, Alex?", "4": "I agree.", "5": "Tanya?", "6": "I agree.", "7": "[Avila 00:01:52]?", "8": "I agree.", "9": "Mike.", "10": "I agree.", "11": "And Emanuel.", "12": "I agree.", "13": "Thank you. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation, and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. One, to speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time and allow others to finish speaking. Take turns, stay curious, and ask honest questions. Pause if you need to and take time for reflection. Listen generously and assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have impact. And when possible close out any unnecessary programs, applications, notifications, and put your phones and other devices on silent. Remember to mute out when you aren't talking to allow people the space. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you'd like to add or change? All right. Let's go.", "14": "So for the ease of this conversation, we're going to use a circle process where each person will take a turn, and what we can do now is just go in the order that people responded in the chat. I'll go in that order. Cool, is everyone okay with that? That is the order we're going to use for our circle process, but, also, if you feel that you don't have anything to say or you want to skip or let us come back to you, feel free to do so. You can always pass.", "15": "Okay, so let's start with a quick round of introductions. We want you to share just your first name, or your pseudonym, and in addition to your first name, please share a little bit of background info about who you are, where you live, and what you do, and of value, that is important to you. I'll start. I'm Yule. I'm the community builder for New York for Local Voices Network. I live in Brooklyn, Fort Greene by way of Flatbush and my value today for this conversation is family because I realize how important that is these days. Connecting with our family is awesome, and I love them dearly, so my value coming into this is family. I'll pass it to you Tanya.", "16": "Hi, I'm Tanya. I'm a policy analyst at the New York City Department of Health. I live in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn and I really value movement, both physical and mental.", "17": "Thank you.", "18": "I'm Aviva, I live in Chinatown. I am an artist and also volunteer and am a collected member at the Trans Oral History Project and I am valuing openness right now.", "19": "Awesome, thank you. Alex.", "20": "Hi, I'm Alex. I'm the head of the New York City Local Voices Network Chapter, and I value that community first value that we talked about a little bit in the training, just the idea that we're not coming into a new community with a project that is inflexible and we're opening ourselves up to the expertise of whichever community we work with.", "21": "Awesome. Thank you Alex. Mike.", "22": "Hi, I'm Mike, I'm president of an organization called Out My Closet. I am from Pelham Bay, the Bronx, and what I value is the initiative of programs as such to learn more about the communities that we are supporting and better means of effectively creating programs and policies that will best influence and support their lives.", "23": "Thanks Mike. Emanuel.", "24": "Emanuel Bloomfield-Jones, co-president of the Friends of Mariners Harbor. I live in New Jersey. In regards to a value, just with this current climate, I would say really just health.", "25": "That's a good one. Right on the nose. We'll actually jump into our next round, and that is to invite you to share a little bit about yourself. And since we'll be talking about health and well-being today, I'd like you to take a minute to think about what health and well-being look and feel like to you. So, in that, let's think of a time, a place, or a story where you felt that you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. For some prompts, to also have you think about, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, what were some factors that supported that, and just how did you feel overall? So Tanya, when you're ready, I'll pass that to you.", "26": "Did you want to model it Yule so I know how brief to keep it? (laughter)", "27": "Sure, I usually step back in this part of the conversation, but I can for sure. Definitely when I was younger, I actually personally, I'm not afraid to share this, I actually was born with sickle cell anemia, and so, in terms of my health and well-being, a lot of what I felt like at my best is kind of like when I was in my teenage years, I had a lot of my parents' support in a lot of my health decisions there, but yeah, went from that to being in college. I just remember having a lot more energy because I was eating better, I was taking care of myself and that was really I think the time that I really took control of my health. Being younger I didn't really understand it as much as I did, and from, I guess, then till now, just having that understanding really helped shaped that and I felt at my best in my late high school/college years.", "28": "Thanks.", "29": "Hope that's a good start.", "30": "I appreciate it. For me what came to mind was, ironically when my mother was diagnosed with stage four cancer, for me I didn't know how to handle it, and she was told she had less than a year to live, and she's alive and well today which is amazing, but not knowing how to handle it, I joined Team In Training for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and through that, you fundraise money for the cause, which was suddenly really near and dear to me, and so I felt like I was doing something for her, and they train for you an endurance sport.", "31": "And so I physically was training for a century ride, which is a 100 mile bike ride one day. And so I joined this huge community who was also training for the same event, and had some kind of tie to the organization as well, and so it really provided this physical and mental space to just connect with people while feeling like I was... while I was helping. In a situation where I didn't know what else to do, I was at least finding space to process and connect with others and fundraise money for research that hopefully could help my mother and others.", "32": "Awesome, thank you for sharing that. Aviva.", "33": "Yeah, when I read that question in your prompt, I was thinking about how huge, obviously... That is such a huge topic, and as everyone has a life-long relationship to their health and others' health, I mean, I was a caretaker through my 20s and I've spent a lot of time hospitals and alternative care clinics, so have a lot of experience, not as a sick person, but in relation to sickness, and also mental illness, in which I've taken care of people also, so, I don't know, I think right now... My wellbeing is kind of situated relationally because I care for people, so a lot of times it's just navigating the boundaries between taking on other people's pain and knowing how to negotiate my limits within that.", "34": "And, yeah, in this current climate it's really intense to have a bunch of people I'm related to through care networks not be able to be served in any way, especially when they work for non-for-profits that uplift and try to support others in need in which then they can't even help people that work for them. So I'm swimming through the confusion of how to support people mentally while they can't be helped physically right now.", "35": "Thank you. Alex.", "36": "I also, in reading this guide, and starting to think about how I'd answer this question for myself in advance and I guess that I've thought about all of the times in my life when I felt like my health has been at its best, have been moments right after it's been at its worst and how those very dark unhealthy moments for me have pushed me to start a new regime and think about my health in a little bit of a different way.", "37": "One of those moments actually was when I worked at StoryCorps and I was traveling around the country and in a different location every single month, and how much I lacked that feeling of community and connectedness and rooted-ness. I was in Denver, Colorado at one point and I was really really down, and I oftentimes push my health, it's like the last thing that I think about. I think about other people's health oftentimes before mine, or my work oftentimes before my body, and my work oftentimes has nothing to do with my body.", "38": "So I just remember in Denver, just finally being pushed to that brink of needing to pay attention to my body and finding a yoga studio for the first time in my life and starting a practice for the first time in my life and feeling what a difference that made, that I was able to participate in that every single day with other people and how I needed that in order to excel in the other parts of my life that I'd prioritized at the time. So that's what I would say.", "39": "Thanks, Alex. Mike.", "40": "In my 20s and early 30s life was great in the sense that things didn't hurt on a regular, like lower back pain, a few years I had odd synchronization out of nowhere, so it put a halt on all the things I actively love like playing volleyball every Friday for hours and jumping and running, and that happened with having a torn meniscus. So overall my experience was learning, or seeing directly how your physical health could directly impact your mental health status, and what types of ways to maneuver that and have... If you're so driven and love to engage actively in health and sports and outdoor recreations, how life-altering these illnesses and diseases, such as mine or others, could have a direct impact and influence on your overall happiness and things that you now have to recreate to produce lifestyle choices that will give you the results that you want, such as good health and fitness.", "41": "Thank you Mike. Emanuel.", "42": "I would say that I'm at my best in regards to health and well-being usually during the spring and summer just because I love to jog and I'm not a big jogger when it's cold outside so usually, the weather breaks, I'm able to just start running. While I'm running I enjoy praying as well, so I feel like that's just a moment where I'm able to work on myself physically, mentally, spiritually. I'm usually really in a good space when it's warm outside.", "43": "Yeah I can also... I second that. I love when it's nice out. I think it helps my health as well. Thank you all for sharing. We are actually going to move on to some conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and well-being in your community and for the purposes of this conversation, we'll invite you to think of your community broadly and share about either your neighborhood community or your social community when you're replying to the questions. And if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community just share which community you're actually thinking of when you discuss your story, because we do like to give you the general ability to refer to which community you choose.", "44": "And so, I have a few questions to start us off with, this will be a good time for some back and forth as you share your stories, and I'll be inviting you to respond to points that resonate to you when they're made by others in the group. So again, the raised hand feature is also there is you want to chime in and be mindful that everyone needs a chance to participate.", "45": "And so, question number one is, what in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and well-being. And think of a time or share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a bit better. Now you can definitely take a minute. We always say pause and take a moment for reflection if you need be. When you're ready we'll start with you Tanya.", "46": "For me I really appreciate, I live near Prospect Park, and just really value the space it offers for physical movement and also just a break from the hubbub of the city. So I really appreciate the parks and open spaces.", "47": "Awesome. Do you have a story from the last time you went to the park?", "48": "Oh yeah, sorry. Lately I've been running so it's been this really wonderful, I've lived in the same place for six years, and have gone to the park many times, and I was running and been taking paths to avoid people, and ended up in a part of the park that I've never been and it felt so cool to be in a city that I've been living in and still discover new places, and there was a waterfall and there were turtles and if I had just sent a photo, nobody would have guessed that I was in New York City and I just loved that escape. I haven't been running in years and with the gym closures right now, this forced me to think about what is still available and just using my park in new way. It was always there, I always appreciated it, but the relief it's bringing now is all the more, all the better appreciated.", "49": "That's awesome. Discovering new things in your city, that's always a pleasure. Aviva?", "50": "Can you repeat the question again, I'm sorry.", "51": "No problem. The question is, what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing and what are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing? And to definitely share a story, if you have one, that'll help us understand.", "52": "I think that... I can't speak from a community point of view particularly. I feel like it's extremely fractured right now, given everyone's immediate reality in which they have access or don't have access to help and so that's hard. I have a privilege of being... I oscillate between my apartment in Chinatown and my father's house, and he lives 30 minutes outside the city, because my apartment's not tenable to live in because I live with someone who's unsafe to be around, so that's been my own circumstance, and I think that this has made me reflect a lot about... I don't suffer domestic abuse, just a weird roommate, but what the realities are for people right now in terms of living in unsafe circumstances.", "53": "Anyway, I don't feel a commonality that's shared that helps us generate support and growth right now. I just feel a lot of connection to that menacing reality of being isolated in certain circumstances. I do find that I have found certain groups on Zoom that have been really helpful. I do think this whatever movement to connect in this virtual way in which I've never met a bunch of these people before has been really uplifting and special.", "54": "I'm in a group called Counting the Omer which is this ancient tradition between two Jewish holidays called Passover and Shavuot where you count the days between and it's this spiritual process of... In Passover when the Jews leave Egypt and are emancipated there's this tradition where because you're physically emancipated doesn't mean you're spiritually or emotionally feeling free and so this tradition of counting the omer is about that process. Like how does one have access to freedom spiritually and emotionally and so it's kind of a study group in looking at that question through ritual and so that's been a really new and enriching experience that I never had before and could only find through this online moment of connection. So that's been really cool for my health.", "55": "Thank you for sharing that and I was also thinking about that in the terms of defining community, now we have this new definition of community through these online virtual conversations where you're creating that, and distance doesn't really... isn't really a factor so, thank you for sharing that. Mike. Oh, sorry, Alex. Didn't try to skip you Alex. Alex, then Mike.", "56": "That's okay. I echo so much of what you just shared Aviva. I think that the idea that my previous feeling and understanding around what I would call my community has been just thrown up in the air and fallen down like confetti a little bit. I think that, having just come back from parental leave, I felt like I had an expectation around the community that I was going to build with other new parents and it is nothing like I imagined it was going to be. And so I think that I've just been confronted with trying to sort through what is my reality versus what is the fantasy of community that I had in my head as something that I'd be able to achieve pre-pandemic or maybe not at all. Who knows if that community would have really existed.", "57": "But, I am part of quite a few Zoom calls with other new parents and it's been I think really amazing just to kind of... There's a resiliency that I think is built in people's ability to express vulnerability at this time and I'm encouraged by how much I've been able to share and how much I've heard other new parents be able to share during this time and I think that we've been able to build something that's like community.", "58": "It's not the type of community that I felt like I was going to be able to build where would I would walk with my stroller in Prospect Park and be surrounded by other new parents sharing stories and having our kids connect face-to-face and so many of those rich in-person luxuries that I was thinking that I might have, but it's a new type of community that I think is built around bonding during a time where we're all feeling pretty vulnerable in this new hat that we're wearing. So I would offer that up and huge plus one, ditto, whatever I want to say, to what Aviva shared around that building of community beyond geographic borders with these conversations.", "59": "Thank you Alex. Mike. You're up for real this time.", "60": "Community has always been big for LGBTQ people and what has demonstrated in my life is that for organizations that are very small we really rely on the community for support because competing for grants, even during COVID, was very very difficult for us, and we obtained nothing, so we went back to the community for resources and support to just get through for the next couple of months. And it was the LGBTQ communities, our peers, people within our age group or our friends of friends that really upheld the mission of the organization. So that has [inaudible] how important it is to engage with community and build together. And a place that we actively used to engage with the community was at a place called Boxers, which is a sports bar, and we created a program there called raise the bar, where we got opportunities to share about our work because we're a very grass roots organization ran by young people in our 20s and 30s who are people of color and first generations in the States.", "61": "So these events where we would create opportunities to share information as well obtain finance through raffles, when that came to a halt, it was very devastating for us so we had to create new opportunities and ways to get money and we did a cool, like a cyber concert last week that we were able raise about $4000 just from having drag queens and performers and LGBT advocates and allies all come together. So I see the importance of having a community even if it's through this new platform which is digital, it's a great tool that could be used to uphold and support from small organizations that are really do direct services for the clients we service.", "62": "Thanks for sharing Mike. Emanuel.", "63": "Yes, I would just say within the Staten Island community, we're very tight-knit, so you have a lot of amazing organizations, elected officials, community leaders who all are able to come together and really just galvanize and support the community in different capacities. So I'm just thinking of everything that's going on right now with COVID, there've been a lot of just events within the different neighborhoods throughout Staten Island where individuals have been able to get masks, free food, and different resources and materials that is needed free of charge and just by everyone coming together to really support one another. So I jusst think that is a beautiful thing that is going on within the Staten Island community.", "64": "Perfect. Thank you all for sharing. Next question is, what are you learning about your community's well being and resiliency in this pandemic that you'd like others to understand? So again, in terms of community it can be however we defined it in our last question or even a different type of community and just share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better. Yep, you're it Tanya.", "65": "So as I shared, I've lived in the same place for six years, but it wasn't until this pandemic that I asked my neighbors if I could get their phone number because they own the place next door and they've been here for more than six years. And so it's really shown just the value of local community to me and so, because we can't just go out to get anything right now, we've borrowed their ladder, we've borrowed tools that we don't want to go to a hardware store or necessarily want to own.", "66": "We met a new neighbor, and after not seeing them outside for the 7:00 PM cheer for a few days, I messaged just to make sure they're okay, because suddenly the default is kind of like, maybe they got sick and so just checking, \"Do you need anything, I'm going to the store.\" And it's something that just has been really beautiful and took me so long to get to know my neighbors. It took this. Me being home more and recognizing like, \"Okay, I can't connect with people who are further away, other than through technology,\" and just made me really appreciate folks who are local and what we can each offer each other.", "67": "Awesome, thank you for sharing Tanya. Aviva.", "68": "I've noticed how amazing... I mean I'm in a lot of different communities that are related to being gay that are like part of night life and fashion and whatever, and I've just noticed how many ways people have figured out how to express themselves online and get paid for it. Like there's been a lot of shows. I went to a drag show last night where you just thumbnail the performer that you like, and so people are figuring out if they can't make money right now being in a club, how is it possible?", "69": "And I've just seen so many really interpretive ways of coming together through that have been really beautiful and fun. And DJs that... Where they've been global where people at different time zones have had the span of one day of a party where people can come in let them know, the DJ, and hopefully these people are getting paid, but it's been a really... I've just been really energized by how well organized so many events have been where I'm like, \"Wait, I'm busy tonight and the next night because people are just trying to put themselves out there right now and connect through the ways that they used to, but through their bedrooms and stuff.\" But also, staging insane sets. So I've just been really galvanized through that kind of spirited interaction.", "70": "Very cool. Alex.", "71": "Yeah, I just want to echo so much of what you both shared around how our desire to connect with people has just been so underscored during this time and has happened on Zoom and happened, in my neighborhood, on rooftops and you all probably... I don't know if you lean your heads out of your windows at 7:00 o'clock and hear the clap for the healthcare workers that happens, or the essential workers that happens at 7:00 o'clock, which is amazing and such an incredible thing for me to be able to share with my son as well who's only three and a half months old, but is something that even he can appreciate.", "72": "I really feel, like I look at him when I bring him to my rooftop and he has a big smile on his face when he can hear people around him who he hasn't met ever, he's only really connecting with me and my husband right now, but he can hear the clapping and the voices and the excitement that people have around just being able to connect with each other and share across rooftops. I think that is a metaphor, a very positive metaphor, for these times and the type of connection that we really feel we want to put out there.", "73": "So, yeah, I feel incredibly encouraged by it. I think that, hopefully, after all of this is over, and who knows what that will look like, we will continue to use the internet in this way. Going back to that Zoom point that you just made, Aviva, or using the internet to connect with other people, I think that this is the ultimate demo around what's possible when it comes to that. Which is really exciting to experience.", "74": "Thank you Alex. I'm excited to know that now Jack is plugged in with us. Yeah, we are going to move on to you Mike.", "75": "So as I stated the last time I spoke. It's so important to have community and how it is really what's going to fuel all the social service agencies and work out there because it's... What I've experienced is that there's still a lot of fear for people who are directly conducting services and those are like essential staff members.", "76": "I saw... Because my work is all volunteer based, the risk that my team members are taking to actively engage, for me it's [inaudible] volumes, and you start looking at your team members in a different light as a leader and you realize that these people who are really passionate about their work, although there's nothing [inaudible] benefit for them personally, their ability to want to give and serve and uphold their communities because they see the intersectionality of homeless and under-resourced LGBT youth who have the intersectionality of being people of color as well, and their commitment to do the work and sacrifice even with maybe their health and livelihood to uphold.", "77": "I feel that those actions were such, oh gosh, building blocks and to continue to propel the work because we see that once there's a need, that there is a community that will respond and uphold each other and that's a big learning lesson and community is the bonds that we create, either if it's going to be in person or digitally, and it's so influential and impactful to engage and uphold support with whatever way we can.", "78": "Thank you Mike, I appreciate that. Emanuel.", "79": "I would say I learned just how strong and how innovative our community is just being able to adapt to Zoom and other platforms when these wasn't platforms that was always used within the community, especially in regards to events, sharing information, doing conversation, different forums, so just seeing everyone being able to just adjust and thrive in spite of everything that is going on. It just shows the strength of the community.", "80": "Thank you. And again, thank you all for sharing. This is usually the part of the conversation where you actually play the highlight and go into something that was taken from another conversation as well, but due to our time constraints and out of respect of your time as well, we are going to wrap the conversation here. If there's any final thoughts or reflections on the conversation that you have, feel free to share and we'll actually answer any other questions that you may have about the process in general and about our full training today.", "81": "I just want to chime in here too to add to what you all just said and just mention that the next part of the conversation is I think a really really important part to get to when you all are facilitating your conversations. This very brief conversation we just had was less than 45 minutes, but the full-length conversation should be an hour and a half, maybe even a little bit longer in some cases. It's really important that you give people the space to feel like they can share for as long as they want to.", "82": "I also just want to say that we did the circle method of conversation for this, but there are tons of tips throughout this guide on how to make it a little bit more interactive and I encourage you all, and I'm talking like we're teaching you about facility, you all are natural-born facilitators anyway, and you can bring your own style to this guide in a way that gets people to talk and gets people to push back and ask questions, and exchange ideas and connect with people as well, even beyond the circle approach that is really a part of the first two questions in here.", "83": "The next part of this guide goes into discussing things that people really want to raise their voices on and I think it's a really important part of the conversation because it really kind of seals it off in a beautiful way. You're talking about your community's health and well-being and key take-aways, personal take-aways and stories around that. And then you're asking people to envision what New York City would look like, what a healthy New York City could look like, which is so important for that TCNY, for that Take Care New York work.", "84": "And the next part around raising your voices just connects to the things that you want people to be able to share in the conversation to summarize it, to seal it up so that when people are listening to this in the future, including our friends at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, that they can really get some of those key take-aways towards the end. And there are a couple of different framing questions around that that we think are super helpful.", "85": "So I just wanted to put that out there just so you all know that we gave you a very very light light light appetizer version taste of what a conversation could look like and I think it's super important to have some skin in the game as facilitators of these conversations to feel how those questions hit you in responding to them and this discussion, before you bring them to the people that you work with. But just want to stop here with our final two minutes and see if you have any questions and also thank you all for diving into this and facilitating. Yeah-", "86": "Okay, so I just want to welcome you all to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you all for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I've begun recording at this time and I need to just share a little information with you before we begin our recording, or conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded, so you all know, and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation.", "87": "First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers and members of the media. To this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, so you all are bringing everything you need to know to this conversation with you, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues.", "88": "In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and well being of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information. I just also want to make that clear. As I said, this conversation is now being recorded, transcribed, eventually it will be transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in the project, at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "89": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consented to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations and communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website or be broadcast on a local radio station. Or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please, please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say I agree. We're just going to go around and I'm going to start and then I'm going to pass it over to Liz, and then [Deb] and then [Ilana]. So I agree.", "90": "I agree.", "91": "I agree.", "92": "I agree.", "93": "Thank you. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and to learn from others in this conversation, and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation today. So, there are also I just want to mention, these guidelines will be in materials that we send you and anyone who participates in your conversation in an email. So you'll get them ahead of time. But just to review, number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time and allow others to finish speaking taking turns. Sometimes this is hard in a Zoom conversation, but we'll do our best. Stay curious, back to Liz's amazing value that she shared in our previous conversation. Please stay curious and ask honest questions.", "94": "Pause and take time for reflection. Listen generously and assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And when possible, close unnecessary programs, applications and notifications, and put your phone on silent, knowing that we are all kind of not very much in control sometimes of our home environment, and whatever comes up is fine. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? You can just nod if you are, and please feel free to share anything that you'd like to add or change. This is a conversation we want to create together.", "95": "Okay, thank you. So, for the ease of this virtual conversation, we're going to use a little bit of a modified circle process, where each person will take a turn. And I'm posting the order, well, the order in which we'll take turns for this conversation will be the order in which you said I agree so. So Liz, and then Deb and then Ilana. I'll help transition us from one person to the next, and you can always pass or ask for us to come back to you. Does anyone have any questions about this process?", "96": "Okay, great. So to begin, we'll just do a quick round of introductions. And this is going to be very similar to the introduction we did in the training, so you're all familiar with it. You can just say your first name or pseudonym. And in addition to your first name, please share a little bit of background info about who you are, like where you live or what you do. And then a value that's really important to you, and how it's related to what brought you here today. So feel free to share a little bit more about your value if you'd like. And for this first round, I will start, even though I will be taking myself out of further questions in the conversation.", "97": "So my name is Alex Kelly... oh, sorry. So my name is Alex, that can be redacted. And I work at the Local Voices Network, I'm the head of the New York City chapter here. I live in Prospect Heights in Brooklyn. And a value that's really important to me specifically with the project that we're currently working on with the Department of Health is this community first value, this idea that we're not just creating a project and plopping it in a community and saying, \"Here you go, go for it. Don't make any changes.\" But we're opening up the process to the community members themselves, and making sure that they know that they are experts. So I'm going to pass it over to Liz.", "98": "Thank you. So I'm Liz. I am the director of Take Care New York at the health department. I live in the Bronx, close to Yankee Stadium. And in addition to the relentless curiosity that I highlighted earlier, I also want to bring up the value of integrity and working in a way that has integrity and responsibility to all the different folks that we encounter, and who we serve in my work.", "99": "And we can just continue on, so-", "100": "Oh, okay, all righty. I was just waiting for [inaudible]. Hi, my name is Deb. And I live in the North Shore of Staten Island, not far from the ferry. I'm originally from Los Angeles. And actually to step out of the role of playing the part of a participant, I assume that prior to this, you'll be collecting all sorts of demographic information on the participants, or no, I'm just curious. Maybe I can ask that at a later time, not to interrupt the flow of it-", "101": "No, that's a very good question. We will have a poll that will pop up at the end of this conversation and that participants can fill out. And Ilana will come up with a different process as well, for the folks that you work with, who might not have that poll that pops up. But that will collect some demographic information.", "102": "Okay, seems like that would be good for data collection. So thank you, and the values again, I think about patience, which is a personal value I need to learn, and probably as part of this process as well, and inquiry, which is part of all that. Did I miss something else? Thank you.", "103": "Hi, my name is Ilana. I live in Brooklyn, Flatbush Midwood section. And going back to my values of honesty, and integrity, I really try to use those values to inform my practice. And I think it's very important that the clients that I work with also have a chance to share their story and be transparent about their experiences.", "104": "All right, thank you all for sharing. So, the next space that I want to enter into together is just an invitation for you to share a little bit more about yourself. Since you will all be talking about health and well being today, I'd just like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and well being look like and feel like to you. Think of a time and a place or a story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, and what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time. And how did you feel? We're actually going to continue with the circle approach for this question. And we're going to go around one at a time to share our stories.", "105": "So please also, I just want to make sure to remind you that this is being recorded. And we ask that you just do not disclose any sensitive personal health information or use the names of other people when telling your stories. So I can actually start here. Ordinarily, I might not jump in and share in this moment, but I'm going to share for the purposes of illustration in this conversation. I used to work at StoryCorps and I was on the road all the time, and I was in a different state every single month pretty much for over a year. And I just went through, in the first couple of weeks of that work, feeling really just kind of ungrounded.", "106": "I was in Denver, Colorado at the time, and I was in this space of like living someplace, but not really living there and being away from my community and the people who I knew back in Brooklyn. And not really having anything that anchored me. And I can remember just feeling kind of just super, super down. I wasn't eating very well, I was living at a hotel. And so there were so many different elements in my life at the time that kind of contributed to that downness. And I actually, kind of in a moment when things just felt really, really bad for me, I decided that I was going to look up a yoga class in the area.", "107": "And I'd only ever taken video yoga at the time. So this was like a big kind of decision for me. And I went to this yoga studio in this sweet, quiet street in Denver that kind of felt like my childhood neighborhood in Bangor, Maine, honestly. And I took my first in person yoga class. And it took a couple classes for it to sink in, but that feeling of community and groundedness, and just being able to connect with other people around me in a little bit more of a meaningful way, even when I was not in a space that I was very familiar with, and had my first kind of like real job of my life working at StoryCorps.", "108": "It just routed me and I was able to continue that practice there and I felt really grateful for it. And I did it everywhere I went, I found a new yoga studio and a new kind of pop up community for myself. So that's what I will share. And we'll just continue in the same order as we did for the first question, so Liz.", "109": "Awesome. Thank you. So I also just returned from family leave, I have a nine month old daughter, and I was very lucky to be able to stay home with her for six months. And for the first three months, my husband was able to stay home as well. I'm not going to say that those three months were an easy time, the first three months with a new baby of kind of getting to know each other, and figuring out how to sleep and all of those things. But the fact that we were able to be together as a family, even for that short period of time, felt so vital and so healthy. And the ways that our community kind of surrounded us in that time coming by with food, or one friend sent us an entire order of groceries one day. And I joked that it's funny to see what other people put in their grocery carts. And think that you might want in your grocery carts. It was great, it was stuff that I never would have gotten for myself.", "110": "And really kind of nurturing and wonderful. Other friends bought us brought us homemade food, one serving that we could eat now and another serving that we can freeze to eat later. But all of that, in spite of the fact that it's hard to have a new baby and to make that adjustment, the fact that we were able to do it together felt so nourishing. And very much how I think about health. I'll pass to Deb.", "111": "Oh, okay. Hi. I don't know why my camera doesn't totally work. Health, I think of sort of different areas, but physical health, obviously, and mental health. And it feels like there are aspects of both that are under my control and aspects of both that aren't. And with respect to physical health, I have been an on and off practitioner of yoga for 20 plus years, so and building on what you said, off lately, because I whacked out my shoulder, and because we're in quarantine, and I feel the effects of not doing it. So physical health, just movement and being thankful that I have the opportunity to eat healthy food, whether or not I make those choices. It's available to me. So that's a good thing.", "112": "And then just sort of the mystery of whatever could happen physically that we all sort of grapple with, is out of control. And same with mental health. I mean, I think that there's circumstantial sort of realities that impact that, and some other sort of level of mystery that I think people sort of feel up and down. But I think to feel sort of the whole in that way, the physical activity is always helpful; to have some routine and discipline in that regard. And also networks and relationships that help, sort of feeling like in all levels that, there's, for lack of a better word of bottom, you've got relationships that are holding you. Or socioeconomics; that you're not looking down in abyss, because I think that that's anxiety provoking and I'm thankful not to have been there for any extended period of time. But all of those obviously impact.", "113": "So recent experience, and I'll just go with extremely recent and congratulations on babies, that's beautiful. Is a just a week ago, my family went on a, we're out of quarantine but responsibly with masks, but we went to New Jersey and went camping for two days. And it was my younger daughter's, she's turning 10, and that was her request, and we put up a tent. And so it was my 10 year old and my 12 year old and then my step kids who are 13 and 11. So you can imagine that we're busy... and my fiance. But there was something about just getting outside. I mean, the moment I was outside and the tents started going up, you know, after months of [quarantween] as I like to call it, which has been interesting, to be not having to look around the house and think about what I'm going to clean, or cook or what work I'm going to do. And to hear the trees and to be outside was... I noted, and I don't always note relaxation.", "114": "I think it comes over you when you don't even recognize that it's happening. But I felt for those two days, I was so aware of this loosening and the sense of health and well being that, especially in these past couple months, has been... I didn't even realize how stressed I'd been until I lost that stress. Because there are always highs and lows within the day. And so much that you're focusing on right in front of you, that I don't think you recognize all of the impacts on your mental and physical health, until you feel it all sort of pouring out of you, and trees and things help. So that's my shtick. And I pass it to Ilana.", "115": "Thank you. I guess congratulations are in order for everyone. So congratulations to all of you and your respective happy occasions. I'm thinking about a time in my life where I was abroad for about a year. And just like Deb was saying, my physical health and my mental health and everything that was going on for me at the time was kind of like, out of whack, because I was so far away from family and feeling lonely, needing more social supports that I had available. And I think something that I've learned and built upon since then, is the idea of self care, and how important that is. And I reached out and like we were saying earlier in the training, just I tried to go out of my comfort zone and get into that growth zone and do different things.", "116": "I took a yoga class like Alex and Deb were saying, I reached out to people in my group, in my area; a mentor someone that I can talk to. And just as far as physical health, just continuing the idea of self care that, it hasn't stopped since that time when I wasn't at my best. And I continue that journey of self care now, and I'm on an intuitive eating journey which is very personal, but so amazing and teaching me so many different things about my physical health and my mental health. So that has been... and the intuitive eating part of self care has been really an eye opening journey. So, yeah.", "117": "Thank you all so much for sharing. It's incredible how many common threads we have here. And threads that I encourage you all to pick up on in the conversation that we're about to have. That was a bit of a circle approach, like I said, so we went from one person to the next and you shared, and I encourage us to continue to hold the space for each other in the conversation, as we did in that moment. But I also as we move on, want to make it a conversation. So feel free in moments when you feel like you have something to build on, after you heard somebody else speak, feel free to build on that, feel free to ask questions, feel free to just share how you prefer to share in a conversation, given the guidelines that I shared at the beginning of our conversation.", "118": "So I want to move into a space that allows us to think a little bit about our communities when it comes to health and well being. And our hopes and concerns for health and well being in our community. And I know that community has so many different definitions, but for the purpose of this conversation, I just want to invite you to think of community a little bit more broadly, and share about either your neighborhood community or your social community; totally up to you. And when you're responding to questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, just share which community you're thinking of when you share your story.", "119": "So I've got a few questions to start us off. But we hope that this will be a time for some back and forth, like I was saying. And I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group, while also being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. So, the first question that I just want to throw out there for us to talk about, and I also just want to mention that when I say us, I'm going to be taking myself out of the sharing at this point, as somebody who just wants to hold the space for you all to share.", "120": "I will be here actively listening and part of the conversation as such, but I will not be sharing stories from here on out. The question that I want to share is, ask is, what in your community is working well to support your health and well being? What are some of the people, places or things that have positively positively contributed to your, or your community's health and well being? And I'd like to invite you to share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better. So anyone can start here, and feel free to open us up into just talking about this a little bit more.", "121": "I'll jump in to get through the silence. I guess, like you said, talking about the community, it can be your sort of friendship community and/or your physical, geographic community and both I feel very impacted by, and I can talk about my friendship community within my geographic community. And well, first of all, Staten Island is such an interesting place, because it's small enough that it seems like no matter what context you enter, you'll find somebody you know from another context or similar context. And I feel like those overlapping circles of relationships have been very supportive for me since I've moved here. So within even my neighborhood, you go to the market or you go to a centralized spot or wherever, chances are more likely than not strangely that you'll meet someone you know. I worked as a reporter for a long time, so that extended my circle of knowing, but I'm just talking about friends, acquaintances and things.", "122": "And I'm not extraordinarily social when I have to be, so it's nice to sort of be out there and say, hello, I shoo social media and all that. So I get my opportunity for in-person contact, which is wonderful. And on Staten Island, I think, for that, in terms of community health or things that promote the health there, it's nice, it's not like New York City in that it's open. You can go to a park and not have to deal with hordes of people, or fight for space. And there's a place around the corner from my house called Snug Harbor Cultural Center where my daughter went to school as a toddler. And so many people I know or came to know did, and then we went to different schools and whatnot, but it's just a giant, open, beautiful space with museums that are a little bit sad and in need of funding, but they exist. And a children's museum where you can always play with the toys and you don't have to wait.", "123": "And all of these sorts of opportunities for interacting with nature, each other, culture, et cetera. And then when I talk about my physical community, or just sort of my general neighborhood, that's a different story. In and among my neighborhood, as I think we all as New Yorkers feel the story where you can live in a sort of [inaudible] neighborhood where you have your friendships and you know, I live down the street... It's a neighborhood window, I encounter a lot of poverty. And I've noticed recently, especially after quarantine, there's a sort of small commercial area that's down the street from my house, where it's the Spanish English stores, and it's always been a little on the down and out. And can walk my daughter to school through it, or I'll go for a jog, this is my neighborhood, even though in Staten Island you've got a lot of residential areas.", "124": "And what I've noticed more and more is how the overall sort of sadness dropped out in this increase in homelessness, increase in desperation. And it's been any time of day, and we talk about health, people in wheelchairs looking lost the sort of quintessential picture of what one would think of destitution. And when I think of, for example, that I live up the street from public housing project, that's more along the lines of kind of institutional poverty, but you've got at least some bottom line. I mean, most of the people there are stabley housed in one form or another. I mean, obviously, we don't have to talk about the dynamic that's going on today in terms of the world and people's relationship to the world based on their skin color, culture, et cetera, and that community deals with it.", "125": "But what I've noticed, in particular of late, has been a shift downward for people who are less connected to any sort of system, that I see so prevalently in my neighborhood, and it's of concern. And that's the negative, and it's hard because I think people who are that marginalized have a hard time accessing those sorts of support systems. I mean, they're just as close to this beautiful cultural center as I am, but they might not have the transportation or the ease to get there and take a breath. And so that's, I think I meandered in my response, but there it was.", "126": "I think that was really great and articulate and it was making me think of a location where I work down Coney Island. A few weeks ago, I participated in a food distribution that we did through my office, the Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island. And I work mainly with Holocaust survivors for the JCC services, a lot of seniors in the greater South Brooklyn and the whole Brooklyn area actually. But the food deliveries that I did happened to be in the direct Coney Island area. And a lot of the buildings where I went were the NYCHA buildings. And even though I work in this community, and I drive past those buildings every day, I never actually went inside.", "127": "And I know earlier on someone was mentioning a certain aspect of NYCHA, and how there are health issues there. And by going inside and seeing firsthand what those buildings look like, and there weren't really residents out and about, but there were a few people around, and seeing firsthand what that's like, instead of just driving past everyday and not really checking in and getting a deeper idea of what it's like, that was really eye opening. And I know that there's some development happening in the Coney island community and I just hope that people who live in the community, who have been here for a long time have the same opportunities as those who are coming in now. And their voices are heard and their experiences are taken into account.", "128": "Yeah, I think just to kind of build on some of the some of the threads that I'm hearing in both of your reflections, this piece about systems I think is really important. Something that I've noticed in the last few months about my neighborhood, I've only been living in this neighborhood for a little over a year, I've lived in the Bronx for about 10 years, but I moved last year. And I now live in a really big apartment building with 100 plus units. I live across the street from a park and there's a lot of parks directly in my area. And Deb, what you were saying before about kind of accessing the parks, it feels like particularly in this time, everyone in our community is so dependent on that resource.", "129": "And we're lucky that our parks are big enough that there can be a lot of people there, and they're not crowded and on top of each other. So I would say that the parks are active, but not like crowded in an unsafe way. So I think that is a really, it's a really vital part of our community. Something else that I have seen that's working really well in my community is actually the way that really different people are using social media, specifically in my building, to stay in touch with each other. So my building, we have an official tenant association, and then there's an unofficial tenant association. And the unofficial tenant association has this Instagram, direct message thread, and it's got probably 30 or 40 folks from the building who are on it.", "130": "And particularly now, folks have been using the space to talk about everything from people in our building who are having trouble, who are food insecure, and who need food and need help getting food, and we were able, just at the very small building scale, to organize just a very quick food draft, just among our... somebody reached out and said, \"Listen, I know of three people in the building who are having trouble getting enough food to eat, I'm going to put a box outside of my door. Can everybody just come and bring food.\" And people immediately were like, \"Yes, absolutely, no problem.\" Other people were saying, \"I'm doing a grocery delivery, let me get an extra, I could get extra stuff for them. Let me know what they would like.\" And it's been incredible.", "131": "And so it's everything from things like that, that are so kind of vital, to taking care of the very explicit needs of folks for survival. And then it's also like, \"Hey, did you know about this arts and culture thing that's going on? There's this program online and I'm going to check it out, if folks are interested, here's the link, here's how you get involved.\" And that dynamic has existed here for a long time. But it's kind of seeing it in action within this moment of crisis, that has made me understand just how vital that is.", "132": "That's incredible, Liz, it sounds like you guys are a real community in your building. Makes me think of my own neighborhood and how grateful I am right now to have neighbors. I live on a more residential street, not in a building, but where the houses are pretty close together. So I know my neighbors very well and we're close, and just being able to step out of my home and talk to people from the porch in a socially appropriate way right now. But just having that connection with them and being able to get out and see how everyone is going through the same thing. And having that sense of community with my neighbors, and being able to share support with each other has been really amazing.", "133": "Yeah, I mean, in these moments, my neighborhood doesn't do this, but I have driven through neighborhoods where at certain times, 7:00 PM and all of a sudden people emerge, as we've all read about and clap and smile at each other and wave. And maybe that will start going by the wayside now that everything's sort of opening up and people are feeling more relaxed about whatever quarantine we had been in, which is its own thing. But I think the whole idea of social media as a bonding is really interesting. And maybe I'm just too old, but I always feel like social media is such a double edged sword, and especially when you're faced with the vast of it, and the endlessness of possibility. And I'm dealing with a 12-year-old and a 13-year-old, who are really trying to navigate in that.", "134": "And helping them navigate when I myself don't even enjoy being in that space. But what's interesting to me is when you do, like what you were explaining Liz, with your limited sort of community, where you know there's sort of a finite number of people, and it's a way to facilitate connection that you wouldn't necessarily be able to do in a helpful way, without it being just so overwhelming. I see the value in that and how that community as you say, might not have even come to be were it not to have been for this moment. You wouldn't say hello to someone in the elevator, or hear some things [inaudible] maybe the old school bulletin board. I don't know if people still do that.", "135": "So I see the value in that, and especially the service value, which I think makes everybody feel good. I keep threatening to go through all of our old clothes and fold them up and figure out where we're going to take them, because I think that that's probably very important to do at this moment in time, to feel like you're doing something for other people.", "136": "Yeah, no, totally. And it's interesting, kind of thinking about the moment, my husband and I were talking about this lately. So I work in public health, and then I feel like I still really had these blinders on in terms of what it really means to respond to an emergency, or respond to a crisis. And something that I realized that I had assumed, really for my entire adult life, is that I had this very clear thing in my head that, if I ever have to respond to an emergency, personally, it's going to be a hurricane. Like in my head, the only emergency that I could ever possibly have to deal with was a hurricane. And I understood from kind of reading about emergency preparedness, things about having a go-bag and having adequate food and water on hand. And I kind of knew all of that stuff intellectually.", "137": "And kind of was successful to various levels of actually being prepared. But the thing that this has made so clear to me is how, actually what it is about is relationships. The relationships that we have with each other in our places, but also kind of what different people are saying and in our non-geographic communities, like, that's the thing, it is the thing. And I feel kind of stupid, because I'm like, how did I not know that? How has it taken kind of all of what has happened now, to make this very obvious thing so apparent to me? But here we are.", "138": "Yeah. Thank you all, for sharing on this. There're so many more questions I'd love to ask you now, but I think that just based on time, because it's 12:20, which is crazy, we're scheduled to finish up at 12:30. I'm curious, if you'd like to just reflect a little bit on what a healthy New York City could look like. What would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would that feel like? Even beyond the pandemic, given everything that you all just shared about what you're observing during this time in your communities? Are there ways that you see all of that being sustained, the healthier parts, the parts that we want to keep? And feel free to popcorn style it, we don't have to go around in a circle; anybody can start.", "139": "I think what we've all been saying about having connections, social connections, and the neighborhood and the building and the community is a huge part of staying healthy and continuing to be healthy. But honestly, I'm not sure if things are going to stay the same as they are now, the connection that we're having now, if that's going to continue on forever. Because we're in this situation, in this pandemic now, it's creating this sense of needing to connect and this sense of togetherness. I hope it's going to continue. But yeah, I honestly don't know.", "140": "I don't know, to sort of build on that, so many of these health inequities that really were brought to the fore by the pandemic are things that everybody knew about anyway, but now are so much more apparent. If out of that, will be some movement, like you said, to help create connections and access. And what a healthy New York would look like, I don't know, I mean Staten Island is the one borough without a public hospital. The local hospital that's near where I live is, I'm not going to... we'll go off the record on that, because it's a disaster. And then there's another hospital. But that should not be considered the center source of health. There's so many other things like the parks and all the social determinants that really impact it. And like you said, Ilana, relationships.", "141": "And I'm curious to see how we do come out of this crisis with whatever we've learned, and how that may carry over to ourselves, like individually and community. I don't know, I think we've all probably, in our line of work, discussed over and over again, the need for green space and the need for access, and all of those buzzwords. How to make that a truth, I don't know. I think everyone's struggling with that. And I don't know how this [inaudible], to use the word of the day, could pivot into some sort of better truth and better access for everyone, or some awareness. I'm still thinking about it, as I'm sure everyone else is. So it's hard for me to say what a healthier New York is, without giving some sort of utopian vision of everyone living next to a park, and everyone having community and a healthy food store.", "142": "And the mental health and physical health, to be able to actually make use of it. That would be nice though, if it were available. Primary care ease, and I think one of the interesting aspects that did come out of this, and I know we're kind of dealing with time here, is the fact that a lot of the activities in which we engaged, we realized we could do potentially online, which is sort of creepy in a Sci-Fi way, but it's also probably helpful. Like you can't go see a doctor, well here, why don't we have telemedicine or something along those lines? And if there could be larger sort of systems implemented for people who don't have access, then maybe that could be one positive outgrowth.", "143": "Yeah, absolutely. I mean it's funny, I feel like now is the time for utopian visions. It's better than the dystopian visions for sure. I read somewhere recently that I that I think is maybe, is relevant here, that this moment gives us the chance to really interrogate everything that we've taken for granted. And so what you're talking about in terms of just something like telemedicine. Just a kind of inside thing that I know, because of the work that I do, and maybe you guys see this in your work is, one of the biggest barriers to telemedicine was the way that people get reimbursed by Medicaid, or the way that doctors get reimbursed by Medicaid. And so they didn't have a financial interest to do that.", "144": "And so I feel like we have had a glimpse in this moment of what it looks like when actually promoting health is the bottom line. And granted, like Ilana was saying like, it is this temporary moment where we're like, for a second, we've kind of stepped back and be like, okay, we all have to work together right now. Because lives are at stake, and it's vital that we do that. And so it's my hope that we're all kind of continuing to reflect in our communities, in our networks, and to talk about those things, and to talk about the fact that that's happening. Because I really want to hold on to those things and that spirit of, let's all work together, because that's what's needed to make sure that everybody can be healthy. Because ultimately, I think that that sense of kind of collective accountability for health, is really what it looks like.", "145": "Thank you all for sharing. So ordinarily, we would obviously spend a lot more time on these community-focused questions that you see in this guide, that we just spend some time sharing on in this moment. But given that it's 12:26, it is very important even if you're racing, even if you're running out of time, you have two minutes left to do one quick closing question. So, that question for us, I just want to do a very quick circle-go-around. I just want to invite you to share one thing you heard today, in our short conversation that you'll be taking away from this conversation, and that you'd like other people to hear. So much about these conversations is about elevating this important content beyond the Zoom Room that we're in right now. So just one quick thing. And let's actually start with Liz on this one.", "146": "Sure. So one quick thing... man, I feel like so much was said, it's actually hard to kind of sum it all up and pull it all together so quickly. I think that one thing that I'll take away from this conversation is just the commitment to, looking around me and seeing what is is there, and and what is a part of my local network and the systems that surround me, and really thinking about those in a much more kind of serious and committed way, when it comes to my thinking about health.", "147": "And Deb, and then Ilana. Looks like Deb's screen might be frozen, so Ilana, we'll go for you first.", "148": "Okay, so I definitely have to say, I really agree with what Liz just said, looking into my own community and just seeing how things have been different for me during this time, as opposed to how they were before. And what resources I relied on, what resources are more needed, and I think just, it's important to also realize how important telehealth is and all these things that people have been able to do with telehealth and telemedicine, and how we can turn towards that, even after the pandemic is over, to help people access different resources and services.", "149": "Thank you so much for being part of this, and bringing yourselves and being present with each other during the time that we're in right now. I am going to press stop on our recording now. And there's a whole bunch of content left in the script that you can read to people at this point. Basically just making sure that everyone knows that this is being recorded. This is going to be shared back with our partner in this collaboration, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. So I'll kind of leave that to you to read over, but also to share back with the group that you organized, Ilana. I'm going to press stop.", "150": "I'm going to start. Welcome to this conversa- .... Sorry. Welcome to this conversation of Cortico Local Voice Network in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I have begun recording at this time and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation.", "151": "Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes of this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationship with on another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices in need for the communities, to candidates, local policy makers, and members of the media. To this end, we are writing you to have a different type of conversation.", "152": "Local Voice Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences, what the health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recording available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion while the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "153": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent for Cortico, the operator of Local Voice Network, to use the recordings in accordance with this mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.

So please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say \"I agree\".", "154": "Now I need each, from every one of you, to unmute yourselves and say \"I agree\". So I'm a go before you. Jakari?", "155": "I agree.", "156": "All right. And if you don't want to agree, feel free to say that as well, but if you agree, please say \"I agree\".", "157": "Akella?", "158": "I agree.", "159": "All right. Josiah?", "160": "I agree.", "161": "Wonderful. Yasmeen?", "162": "I agree.", "163": "All right. Perfect. So I'm going to keep going.", "164": "We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversations. There are also the materials we sent with your confirmation email. Right? So the first one: Speak for yourself of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, share the time, right? Which is allowing others to finish speaking, take turns. Stay curious, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. When possible, close unnecessary programs, applications, notifications and put your phone on silent. So if you do have another phone, please put that on silent. All right? So that's not going off.", "165": "If everyone on board with these guidelines, what you can do is either you can nod your head, if you have your camera on, if you don't, you can just simply unmute yourself and say that you agree.", "166": "I agree.", "167": "I agree.", "168": "I agree.", "169": "I agree.", "170": "I agree.", "171": "Wonderful. All right. So for the [inaudible] of this virtual conversation, we are going to use a modified circle process where each person will take a turn. I'm going to be... so I'm going to write in the chat room, kind of in the order in which we will be going in, however, I will also kind of just continuously remind you guys as we go if it's your turn. I'll help transition us from one person to the next like I just stated. You can also pass or pass and ask for us to come back to you later, all right? Please... Sorry. Does anyone have any questions about this process?", "172": "All right. So I'm going to take that as you do not have any questions. All right, so what I'm going to do right now is just take a brief second just so I can post the way in which we're going.", "173": "Oh, sorry.", "174": "All right. Please just confirm that you all can see that.", "175": "Can everyone see it?", "176": "All right. Perfect. I see the hand raise. All right. Wonderful. So I'm going to move on.", "177": "So to begin, what we want to do is a quick round of introductions. Please share just your name. In addition to your first name, please share the following: a little bit of background info about who you are like where you live, what you do, and a value that is important to you and how it is related to what brought you here today. So basically just to start it off I'm going to go first, all right?", "178": "So as you know, my name is Emanuel, however a lot of you also call me Greg. So you know me as both. A little bit about my background, I have both a Bachelor's and a Master's in social work. I work at the College of Staten Island. I also work for NYSID. I'm running a transformative mentoring program. Currently I live in New Jersey. And a value that is important to me is youth, right, so I saw that you all are the future. This next generation is going to do amazing things and it's going to really bring us to a better place. So once again, youth are my value.", "179": "So we're going to go in the order in which I posted. So I'm going to ask Jakari to go next.", "180": "My name's Jakari. I currently live in Park Hill. I'm here because it's just a lot of stuff going on around me and I just got to get away from it. That's it.", "181": "All right. Well a little bit about your background. So I know you said live in South Park. What about what school are you in? Anything of that nature.", "182": "Oh. Well I graduated. I'm in trade school now. I got into carpentry. When school opens back up, I'm going back for automotive.", "183": "Yeah. Wonderful. And what's of value? Something that you value that is important to you.", "184": "Life.", "185": "Wonderful. Thank you.", "186": "All right, next. Akella.", "187": "Hi, my name is Akella Austin. I live in [inaudible] Harbor. I have a Bachelor's Degree in psychology. I work for AHRC in NYSID. One thing that I value is being, I guess, a helpful part of my community.", "188": "Wonderful. Josiah?", "189": "My name is Josiah and I live in Stapleton and I'm a senior at [inaudible] High School. Something I value is youth because I think that youth is the future for us.", "190": "Wonderful. Thank you.", "191": "And lastly, Yasmeen.", "192": "My name is Yasmeen. I'm graduating from [inaudible] High School this year. I'll be going to college to study psychology. And some-... Oh, I'm from Stapleton. And something that I value is respect because nothing comes in this world without respect. You have to respect yourself and you have to respect others too.", "193": "Wonderful. Thank you.", "194": "So the next thing we will like to do is invite you to share a little bit about yourself. Since you'll be talking about health... Since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing looks and feels like to you, all right?", "195": "So I'm going to give you 10 seconds to kind of just reflect on that, right. Health and wellbeing. What does that look like to you?", "196": "All right. So we're going to move on.", "197": "Next, think of a time, place or a story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. So I want you to think about what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time and how did you feel. So I'm going to repeat that. Once again, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel?", "198": "We will go around one at a time to share our stories. Please remember that this is being recorded, so we ask that you not disclose any sensitive personal health information or use the names of other people when telling your stories. All right? So I'm going to ask start. I'm going to go first.", "199": "so I felt I was my healthiest in life last year. The reason why I say last year, just because of everything that's kind of going on in the world right now with Covid, right, so many people lost their lives, so many people are still battling for their lives. In addition to that, I also, kind of what happened to George Floyd a few weeks ago and everything that's been a result of that. So I just feel like this year, so much has been happening and honestly, some that I wish were still in place which is normalcy, right? That was something I really appreciated last year was just... everything seemed normal. I felt like once this year came in everything kind of turned upside down.[inaudible 00:12:06].", "200": "So another question you want to think of when you're answering this is, during that time, right, what do I remember feeling or what do you remember feeling? So I remember at that time last year, especially at the end of the year, I was like 2020 is going to be my year. It's going to be a great year. And I felt like this year is everything, but great right now.", "201": "So we're going to move on and we're going to keep going in that same order. Jakari, if you can go.", "202": "What was the question again?", "203": "Sorry. So can you remember about why you felt you... Sorry. What can you remember about when you thought you were at your best? What were some of the factors that support your health and wellness? How did you feel? So when was the last time you felt like you were at your best health wise, like mentally, physically, or spiritually?", "204": "Still to this day I'm still the same person. Nothing really changed for me.", "205": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Can you think about a time maybe where you just felt like you were in a place where everything was just going ideal?", "206": "It was April 14th when I lost my best friend. My best friend was killed.", "207": "And that's when you felt you were at your best or before that? Can you kind of...", "208": "That's when everything changed. My whole mood ever since then. Everything was starting to get to where it was before.", "209": "I got it. I got it. So everything was good and then that happened with your... I just want to make sure I got it right. With your best friend and you felt like that kind of put you in a darker place.", "210": "Yeah.", "211": "Got it. Thank you for that Jakari. I'm sorry about your best friend.", "212": "Same here.", "213": "Akella?", "214": "Do we have to [inaudible] or is it just okay at a time that you felt?", "215": "Yeah, yeah, yeah.", "216": "Okay.", "217": "At a time. Yeah.", "218": "So I can remember being at my healthiest when I was actually pregnant with my daughter. That was probably when I was at my best because I remember that I was taking care of myself and I knew that I had, that I was carrying someone inside of me. So it was intentional that I really take care of my health and my wellbeing. And during that time I remember feeling love and being taken care of by other people and being happy to be able to give birth at the time.", "219": "Wonderful. Thank you.", "220": "Uh-huh.", "221": "Josiah?", "222": "A time where I felt my healthiest was last year during the summertime because I was really healthy during that time and I was getting a lot of money and right now in the world it isn't that good, but it felt good. And I tried to make this year better, but it wasn't.", "223": "Okay. Thank you. And Yasmeen.", "224": "The time that I felt the healthiest was actually 2020 because like you said, Greg mentioned earlier, 2020 was, well still is my year. I've been working on myself. I've been learning to love myself, respect myself and others and just put myself first. I was going to the gym. Unfortunately now it's closed, but I mean I've made a lot of progress and even though all of everything is on pause right now, this is still a time to... Even though I can't work on myself physically, I'm still working on myself mentally and with what you said is going on with the protests and everything, this is just a wake up call for me I guess.", "225": "Wow, thank you. Thank you all for sharing. It's wonderful.", "226": "So we're going to be moving on, all right? So next what we're going to do is kind of move onto the conversations about hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community, right, so I want you to really kind of have this mindset right now. We're kind of focusing on the community in which you live in, right, or that you're a part of. For the purpose of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly and share about either your neighborhood community or your social community, right, which could be kind of like you with your friends, you with your family, different things of that nature. When you are respons-... Sorry. When you are responding to questions, if you are speaking about an experience to a particular community, please share what the community you are thinking of when you share your story, right. So let's say hypothetically you're thinking of Stapleton, right. You want to say what the name of that community that you're thinking about.", "227": "So I have a few questions to start us off with, but we hope this will be the time for some back and forth amongst you and why you share you share your story I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they are made by others while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate have an opportunity to do so, so each of you will have a turn to go. If I gave you a follow up question you want to ask someone, if you wanted more clarity, if you wanted to just chime in off the back of them, feel free to do so. If we could kind of go back and forth, think about when we do circle activities. This is the same thing just virtually.", "228": "So the first question that we're going to focus on and we're going to each take turns answering, but you're going to each take turns answering these questions is, what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. So we're going to keep following that same order. So Jakari, I'm going to ask that you go first, please.", "229": "Can you say the question one more time?", "230": "Yeah, of course. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing. Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "231": "Well when this first started happening everybody was getting everybody masks and gloves and people were going around making sure everybody was secure and had supplies and stuff like that. When I saw that, I was like... Seeing the neighborhood coming together, it brought a little tear to my eye, but that was pretty much it.", "232": "I got it. So you're talking about in regards to the pandemic. So once these kind of like that the whole unity among the community that was something that you really appreciated?", "233": "Yeah.", "234": "Did anyone else feel that way maybe about their community as well, just when you think about what's been going on in the world in regards to the pandemic, the shelter in place. Has anyone else kind of seen that unity within their community? You can unmute yourself and share if you would like.", "235": "All right. If not, we can go to the next person. Akella?", "236": "I've seen unity in the communities. Recently with the marches I've seen a lot of young people get together and I've seen them actually organize and get together to orchestrate the marches and I've seen them get together to do it peacefully. So I think that's one thing that is working well for the community as a whole in Staten island.", "237": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). I got it.", "238": "Something in my community that has worked well to promote wellbeing that I realized are the local churches, the little local church communities. I've seen them open up their doors in certain situations. Open up their doors to promote the community. I know there's one church in my community which is in Mariners Harbor. They actually open up their doors every, I think every month. At least the fourth Sunday I think it is, of the month and they feed anyone who wants to come in to eat, the homeless, whoever you are, bring your children. So that's something I've seen that they've promoted in the community in [inaudible] and I know of another church they have a pantry where you can come in, you can get food. I've actually volunteered there many times before. In that community, in the West Brighton community, where you're able just to come in and they've kind of build a little following or community among themselves where people come in and they get to hear their stories. So that's something that I've seen that worked well.", "239": "Wonderful.", "240": "The people... So I think that also can work well with the people and places because I know that there are other things that the church community has done to be able to make the community's wellbeing a priority. So I've seen the churches get together and do things for the children and I know during Halloween they had a little trunk event where the children didn't have to go out into the community, into individual houses. They would come to the community and the people donated candy so they can go into people's trunks and just trick-or-treat there. So that was another thing that I've seen. So I think the church as a whole would be something that's positive and to promote wellbeing in the community.", "241": "Thank you so much. Appreciate it.", "242": "Josiah.", "243": "Something [inaudible] in the community is the food they're giving out. They're giving out school lunch at some schools that I live by and that's helping out a lot.", "244": "And what community is that? What neighborhood?", "245": "Stapleton.", "246": "Repeat that. I'm sorry.", "247": "Stapleton.", "248": "All right. So some of the free lunches that's being given out. Have you taken advantage of it personally?", "249": "Yeah.", "250": "That's awesome. What about anyone else? Has anyone else taken advantage of some of the grab and go bags through the DOE?", "251": "So...Yasmeen?", "252": "I haven't been to any of the schools yet, but I might. I might end up going. But I've seen a lot of unity in Stapleton. The Carter Center had an event where they were giving out food. They were giving out more than food. They were giving out books, cleaning products, stuff for... what is it, health insurance. Yeah, health insurance. Yeah, they were giving out stuff for health insurance, measuring cups and just random stuff like [inaudible 00:23:49], a t-shirt and then that same day I was walking to the bus stop and the church, a guy had told me that Stapleton UAME Church was giving out food too, so I definitely went there and I got food from there too.", "253": "But I took advantage of... There's this organization, I forget what it's called, but they said that they try to come every two weeks. They've been giving out free stuff. I've been really appreciating it. They gave out cereal, pasta, just a whole bunch of different stuff and you were able to even get more stuff than what you asked for because they just had so much and they were willing to just give the extras out.", "254": "Also, today I actually wasn't expecting to see a lot of people cleaning the buildings and stuff especially since the Covid, but ever since the virus, I've always seen people cleaning the buildings. Even today I've seen a lady on the elevator, she had the mop and the bucket going down to another floor top mop every floor and I really appreciate that because it's important because even though we still are battling this, we still have to go out and still have to make sure everything is clean.", "255": "Wonderful. Now when you say in the building, can you just kind of be a little more specific in regards of the community or the name of the building? What kind? Which buildings?", "256": "Oh I'm sorry. Stapleton.", "257": "All right. Wonderful. Thank you. Now has anyone else taken advantage of the event that she mentioned like at the Gerard Carter Center. Did anyone go there? Has anyone been getting some of the food off those trucks that's been coming around and giving food or any food pantries? And I'm not going to call on you individually if you could just unmute yourself and share.", "258": "All right. So I'm going to take that as no one else. Not a problem.", "259": "So we're going to go to the next question. What are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency, I definitely said that wrong, in the pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "260": "Can you repeat...", "261": "[crosstalk 00:26:14].", "262": "Can you repeat that? I'm sorry. Can you repeat that? That was a lot.", "263": "Yeah. Yeah, yeah. What are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that would help us understand it a little better.", "264": "Jakari?", "265": "I don't got nothing.", "266": "All right. That's fine.", "267": "Akella?", "268": "I can't really say a lot about the... I'm going to say about the community that I live in, but maybe I can. I want to say that in the community that I live in, I think the neighbors and the people in...", "269": "And what community is that?", "270": "Mariners Harbor.", "271": "Okay.", "272": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). I think the neighbors as a community, a small community gathering together, people who know people, that type of thing. I think they have really banded together. I know people are actually checking on the people in their neighborhoods here. I know that my next door neighbor for instance, has checked on me. I've checked on my neighbor, things like that. I think that people are really taking to... thinking about who may need help or as far as is anything that... any resources that are outside. I think people are willing to share that. I've seen stuff on social media where people were trying to get the word out.", "273": "I think Yasmeen was talking about the trucks that are going around and giving out food and different resources to everybody, so I've seen people in their small community groups I would want to say, really help each other. Really put out the word for resources. Really try to check on each other and their wellbeing. So I think that is an important part, but not... I don't really have an experience where there was the whole people...like the whole community, I haven't had that experience as of yet in Mariners Harbor or I haven't heard of it yet, just people maybe on an individual level.", "274": "Thank you.", "275": "Yeah.", "276": "Josiah? And if you need me to read the question again, I have no problem doing so.", "277": "Can you read the question again please?", "278": "Yeah, of course. And I'm actually going to kind of rephrase it a little bit as well. So just think about kind of what has been going well in the community, right. So since everything has been going on with the pandemic, what have you noticed about your community's strength, right, in regards to health and wellbeing? What has stood out to you? What has surprised you in a positive way? Just how they all maybe came together or how they've been supportive and different things of that nature, if that's the case at all.", "279": "I guess unity because they're always outside all the time every single day, so they really do be supporting each other.", "280": "And now when you say they, so and [inaudible] the community, where do you live? Where are you from?", "281": "Huh?", "282": "[inaudible] the community and what do you mean by they? Like workers, residents.", "283": "All the residents.", "284": "All right. And what kind of stuff have they been doing to really show kind of how have they been kind of overcoming kind of everything that's going on in the world?", "285": "[crosstalk 00:30:16].", "286": "I'm sorry. It was kind of going in and out. If you could say it again, I apologize.", "287": "Oh. I said they were giving out food.", "288": "All right.[crosstalk 00:30:30]. And as fellow residents?", "289": "Yeah.", "290": "That's wonderful. Very good.", "291": "And Yasmeen?", "292": "One thing that stood out to me the most, it was really funny, but I'm glad that I just witnessed... I mean I'd seen it. I guess residents in Stapleton that are always on the same main street that we have, which is Broad Street.", "293": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "294": "They're usually outside most of the same people. Similar, familiar faces always on the block, but it was funny because they were arguing when this all started about Covid and yelling at each other which I know that they're all friends, but they were yelling at each other about how is it spread, yelling at each other, making sure that they have on masks, gloves, and... It was funny because it looked like they were arguing, but after that, I've seen a lot of them being protective after that and I'm glad that they were educating their friends on that.", "295": "Wow. Thank you. Has anyone else noticed anything like that within their community as well?", "296": "All right. So we're going to move on.", "297": "So here's a question for more reflection. So given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would it feel like? So I'm going to repeat that. Given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy, right, what would that look like and what would that feel like to you? So what were your ideal New York City kind of look like and feel like? Jakari.", "298": "Repeat the question one more time.", "299": "Yeah. So what would your ideal New York City look like and feel like in regards to health. If you think about what would it look like, an ideal city where everything was just kind of good, everything was going perfectly. What would that look like to you?", "300": "I don't know. It would look good. To me it didn't really change, it was just like the news was just saying everybody on lockdown. I was outside throughout this whole time throughout the whole thing. I was probably only inside probably one week I was in the whole four months. So it was like... I don't really know how it would look.[crosstalk 00:33:15].", "301": "So let's say separate from the pandemic, right, let's just say... Let's say you were the mayor of New York City.", "302": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "303": "What are some things you would want in this city to make it kind of equal for everybody to make it fun, to make it lively, to make it healthy for everyone in this city. What are some things you would do if you had that power and ability?", "304": "I don't know. I probably will... I don't know. That's a good question.", "305": "Do you want us to come back to you? Maybe you could think about it.", "306": "Yeah, come back to me. Come back to me.", "307": "Not a problem. Will do.", "308": "Akella. And if you need me to read the question again I will.", "309": "Can you repeat it please?", "310": "Yeah. Given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone could be healthy look like and what would it feel like?", "311": "Where everyone could be healthy? I would say healthcare in general. Some type of reform for equal healthcare and I know that might be not just on this level of city, but I know that... I'm sure that there are things that probably can be done on the city level for that to happen. So everyone having access to healthcare centers and their area that provide quality care. I think just having an adequate place for children's... For the community's children to go, after school centers, play centers, things like that. And things in the community for children and adolescents and teens to be able to take part in. So that being all across all communities so that way it would just be... Everyone would have equal chance of these things. There's so many things... I guess there're more things that I can say, but I can say that would mean healthiness in New York City.", "312": "Thank you.", "313": "Uh-huh.", "314": "Josiah?", "315": "I guess I would reopen it. Reopen everything, but I would just make restrictions so everybody can stay safe.", "316": "You said make what? I couldn't hear because your background. I'm sorry. You said make what exactly?", "317": "I'm sorry. I'm about to repeat it. I said I would reopen everything, but I would make restrictions so we all stay safe when everything reopens.", "318": "There were some restrictions, so I got it.", "319": "[crosstalk 00:36:07].", "320": "Like you have to stay six feet apart.", "321": "All right. So that's something you would keep in place for a healthy kind of New York City. So that would be your ideal New York City with everyone being six feet apart and practicing social distancing?", "322": "Yeah.", "323": "All right. Not a problem.", "324": "Yasmeen?", "325": "Basically I feel like we... Well basically you see how they're sanitizing, they're wiping down... I haven't been on the trains, but I have friends that have been. They say that it looks like they've never seen the trains look like that ever and I feel like it shouldn't take a pandemic for that to happen. I feel like stuff like that should be... Stuff like that should happen at least once a week or forever for the city to stay clean. I don't think it should take people dying for something like that to stay in place. I feel like, I don't know, but I think vaccinations should be more available for children, people who don't have healthcare and in order for children to go to school and stuff, that is necessary.", "326": "Thank you. Thank you. Jakari?", "327": "Yeah.", "328": "Were you able to come up with anything?", "329": "Yeah. I would reopen everything. I don't think I would've closed school.", "330": "Got it. But even separate from pandemic, what would an ideal New York City look like?", "331": "It would look good, happy, clean. Everybody doing what they have to do.", "332": "Perfect. Thank you. All right.", "333": "So now we're going to move on. Now we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question, we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you will be taking away from this conversation that you would like other people to hear? So once again I'll repeat that. For the last question we invite you to share what is one thing that you heard today that you will be taking away from this conversation and that you would like other people to hear?", "334": "Jakari.", "335": "The community helping each other. Everybody got to stick together because we're basically all we've got.", "336": "Thank you. I love that.", "337": "Akella.", "338": "Definitely that the communities that I've heard giving out resources, I would definitely share that with people that I know and it just has challenged me to look to see what I'm doing individually to see what I can... What can I do... What more can I do to help the community that I'm in. So it's just forcing me to actually take that with me to see how I could change things from my perspective on where I am and what I'm doing.", "339": "Thank you.", "340": "Josiah?", "341": "It's taught me how I can change things in my own community.", "342": "Perfect.", "343": "And Yasmeen.", "344": "I agree about the community about how this is all we have and as long as you're living here, even if not the community, the borough. You still live in this borough, so I feel like even if you're not going to be a part of your community, you still can be apart in other ways to the whole borough, to the whole New York City actually.", "345": "Perfect. Thank you.", "346": "So those are all the questions that we have for you. Do you have any closing thoughts that you would like to share or other general reflections on the conversation that we had today? So does anyone have any questions? I'm going to basically call you out one by one and you can either say the question or any reflection or you could just say no, all right?", "347": "so Jakari?", "348": "Nothing.", "349": "All right. Akella?", "350": "No, I don't have anything else.", "351": "Not a problem. Josiah?", "352": "No, I don't have anything else either.", "353": "All right. Yasmeen.", "354": "No.", "355": "All right. Not a problem.", "356": "So just a reminder of what will happen with the thoughts you have shared, these recordings will be transcribed, indacted and eventually shared with journalists, public officials and participants in a Local Voice Network. They will also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Department of... Sorry. The New York City Department of Health, all right, New York City Health Department. We encourage you to spread the word about the Local Voice Network. If you want to convene another group of friends to participate or know of others who want to participate, please go to lvn.org. I'm going to repeat that. So if you have anyone who you think know would really benefit from these type of conversations and would love to participate, we ask that you please go to lvn.org or you could share that website with them as well.", "357": "Thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts. So do not sign out yet. We're going to kind of just do a little more, all right? Give me two seconds.", "358": "All right. So we'll just keep going. Please let me know if you are available. Sorry. So I'm available if anyone has any questions all right. We are able to redact comments. So redact any comments that you may request from this conversation. So if you want anything to be removed from the conversation, if you said something and later you're like, \"You know what. Why did I say that? Maybe I don't want that to be shared with others.\" Just feel free to reach out and if you want something to be removed from this conversation all you have to do is just send an email to help@lvn.org. If you would like me to email you that, write in the chat, just say so and I will do so.", "359": "Finally. So before we close this call, there is a brief survey that I would like you all to do. So it will take about two minutes and we're going to drop it in the chatroom, all right. So give me some time. Let me see if it's there. So you see the...[crosstalk 00:43:27].", "360": "I just shared.", "361": "Perfect. If you could all just click that link and if you could complete the survey while you're still on the call.", "362": "And I'm going to stop recording now. Just a huge thank you to everyone who shared on this call. It was an honor and a privilege to be able to be on a fly on the wall for it. Thank you.", "363": "Thank you.", "364": "Y ponemos \"estoy de acuerdo\". Empezando con Esmeralda.", "365": "Estoy de acuerdo.", "366": "\u00bfMarta? Si hay preguntas, por favor, d\u00e9jenme saber antes de decir cualquier cosa. Est\u00e1s en mute, Marta, est\u00e1s en mute. Tania, mientras tanto. Ah ya, ya.", "367": "S\u00ed, estoy de acuerdo.", "368": "Okay.", "369": "Ya. Ya entr\u00e9. Hola.", "370": "Hola Gladys, te pones en mute un momentico y ya te explicamos.", "371": "Okay.", "372": "\u00bfTania?", "373": "Estoy de acuerdo.", "374": "\u00bfLucero?", "375": "Estoy de acuerdo.", "376": "Gladys, bien r\u00e1pido, vamos a tener una conversaci\u00f3n ahorita donde vamos a ser grabadas. Esta conversaci\u00f3n se va a traducir en un manuscrito, que se le va a proporcionar a diferentes periodistas que lo pidan cuando vayan a hacer una historia acerca de nuestra comunidad, o quiz\u00e1s acad\u00e9micos o cualquier otra persona que lo necesite. Entonces, si no queremos resaltar nuestra identidad, no tenemos que decir nuestro nombre y apellido, podemos usar otro nombre mientras tanto. En las preguntas que vayamos a contestar, si hay, un ejemplo, en la historia que vamos a decir de una vecina o de lo que sea, le invito a no compartir ning\u00fan nombre y usemos otro nombre. Entonces, ahorita le estoy pidiendo a cada embajadora que me diga si est\u00e1 de acuerdo con que esta conversaci\u00f3n sea grabada, y si no, aqu\u00ed estamos para contestar cualquier inquietud o pregunta. \u00bfGladys? \u00bfEst\u00e1s de acuerdo? Si est\u00e1s de acuerdo di \"estoy de acuerdo\". \u00bfGladys? No la escucho.", "377": "Perd\u00f3n, estaba en mute. Mayra y yo estamos aqu\u00ed en el mismo tel\u00e9fono.", "378": "Okay.", "379": "Y s\u00ed, yo estoy de acuerdo. Ah\u00ed est\u00e1 Mayra, que diga su opini\u00f3n.", "380": "\u00bfMayra?", "381": "Yo tambi\u00e9n estoy de acuerdo. Estoy de acuerdo yo aqu\u00ed Jessi.", "382": "Mar\u00eda [risas], okay, gracias. [foreign]. Okay, perfecto. Vamos a comenzar. Una vez m\u00e1s les agradecemos. Vamos a participar en esta conversaci\u00f3n donde usted le est\u00e1 dando permiso a Local Voices Network, que es la organizaci\u00f3n que nos acompa\u00f1a hoy, o Redes de Voces Locales. Despu\u00e9s les mando un poquito acerca de esta organizaci\u00f3n, que est\u00e1 haciendo muy buen trabajo en todo el pa\u00eds, nacionalmente, y su agencia [foreign] digamos que es [foreign], van a usar esta grabaci\u00f3n de acuerdo con su misi\u00f3n de promover conversaciones en las comunidades y en los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n para mejorar nuestro entendimiento de los dem\u00e1s. Le invito a que entre a su p\u00e1gina web porque tambi\u00e9n hay historias de otras ciudades, de otras comunidades hispanas, tambi\u00e9n en otros lugares en los Estados, donde tambi\u00e9n amplifican sus voces y es muy bonito escucharlo. Como les mencionaba, esta conversaci\u00f3n es p\u00fablica, y es parte de ella para poder llegar a un periodista local, o se puede transmitir a una estaci\u00f3n de radio local. Podr\u00eda ser que no, que no se use para nada de esas cosas, pero de todas maneras, si s\u00ed se va a resaltar, estamos dando el consentimiento que s\u00ed. Si quieren escuchar algunas otras conversaciones que est\u00e1n sucediendo en la ciudad, les pediremos que nos den su informaci\u00f3n. Yo le puedo dar la informaci\u00f3n a Alex al final de esta sesi\u00f3n, y \u00e9l ya tambi\u00e9n puede compartirles de otras conversaciones que se est\u00e1n dando.", "383": "Antes de comenzar con la serie de preguntas, y yo de tanto hablar, porque el punto de esta actividad es que todas participemos, les voy a explicar c\u00f3mo. Vamos a tener unas peque\u00f1as reglas para nuestra conversaci\u00f3n, para que podamos fluir mejor, para que todas estemos de acuerdo y todas podamos participar bien. Vamos a apagar todos nuestros aparatos que no estamos usando para esta conversaci\u00f3n. Si tienen su tel\u00e9fono, inclusive yo-- Si tienen su tel\u00e9fono al lado no tienen que apagarlo, pero s\u00ed silenciarlo; o nuestro reloj inteligente, lo que sea. Estar bien concentrados por 45 minutos es lo que vamos a hacer ahorita. Vamos a hablar de nuestras propias experiencias, de lo personal, no vamos a hablar de nadie m\u00e1s. Las experiencias y las preguntas las vamos a contestar de una manera personal, c\u00f3mo yo en lo personal veo ta ta ta, c\u00f3mo yo en lo personal veo ta ta ta, [foreign]. Vamos a permitir que las dem\u00e1s hablen por s\u00ed mismas. Todas tenemos historias, aunque vivamos en la misma vecindad, en la misma calle, en la misma cuadra, lo que sea, todos tenemos historias y perspectivas completamente diferentes a veces, porque somos individuales, \u00bfcierto? Vamos a compartir el tiempo, vamos a permitir que los dem\u00e1s hablen y vamos a esperar nuestro turno. Y yo les voy a dejar saber cada pregunta aproximadamente cu\u00e1nto dura la contestaci\u00f3n. Si una pregunta les pido: \"Por favor, en un minuto o dos resuman esto\", por favor, respeten el tiempo y no nos pasemos. Y tampoco no hablemos \"s\u00ed\" o \"no\", que podamos participar y contestar honestamente. Es importante en este di\u00e1logo que mantengamos nuestra curiosidad. \u00bfQu\u00e9 significa eso? Que si una persona est\u00e1 hablando y tenemos una pregunta acerca de su experiencia o lo que sea, y si es respetuosa la pregunta, podemos preguntar honestamente. Aqu\u00ed estamos para preguntarnos, para ser honestos, para reflexionar, para meditar en lo que se est\u00e1 hablando, porque queremos que esto realmente sea informativo para la persona que lo vaya a utilizar, que las voces de la comunidad realmente sean resaltadas por esta conversaci\u00f3n. Se lo debemos a ellos, \u00bfcierto?", "384": "A veces nuestra comunidad no tiene la habilidad o no tiene, tristemente, el privilegio de poder estar en estas plataformas. A veces se les pregunta a otras personas que hablan por nosotros y eso no deber\u00eda ser as\u00ed. Nosotros deber\u00edamos tener el beneficio de poder hablar de nuestras historias, no una persona extranjera, no inclusive un acad\u00e9mico, no un experto. Que nosotros mismos, si somos parte de la comunidad, podamos hablar de nuestras experiencias. Vamos a escuchar generosamente. Vamos a asumir que todos tenemos las mejores intenciones. Lo bueno es que aqu\u00ed estoy leyendo estas reglas, pero nosotras nos conocemos las unas a las otras. Eso es lo bueno de esta conversaci\u00f3n, que tenemos una relaci\u00f3n amistosa y de trabajo, y nos conocemos las unas a las otras. Tenemos que ser conscientes, de todas maneras, de los comentarios que hacemos, por m\u00e1s bien intencionados que sean pueden herir a otras personas, especialmente cuando estamos hablando de algo personal. No siempre tenemos-- es tan personal que no necesitamos que nadie nos diga c\u00f3mo nos sentimos, \u00bfcierto? Es importante respetar eso y como siempre respetar el l\u00edmite del tiempo.", "385": "Si ustedes ven en el chat, pero para las que no pueden ver en el chat, va a haber un orden de participaci\u00f3n. De todas maneras, yo lo voy a decir verbalmente para las que nos acompa\u00f1an por tel\u00e9fono, pero, \u00bfla orden de participaci\u00f3n c\u00f3mo funciona? Yo voy a invitar a una conversaci\u00f3n por medio de una pregunta, voy a hacer una pregunta, y voy a pedir que por el orden de participaci\u00f3n cada una conteste. Entonces el orden es: Marta, Gladys, Tania, Mayra, Esmeralda y Lucero. De todas maneras, yo voy a estar ah\u00ed preguntando, y voy a decir: \"Marta\", y termina Marta y recuerdo \"Gladys\", y as\u00ed vamos para que todas tengamos la oportunidad de participar. Cada una necesita la oportunidad de participar. As\u00ed lo vamos a hacer. Queremos hacer una ronda, vamos a hacer una ronda de presentaciones porque es importante que las personas nos conozcan, conozcan m\u00e1s que todo qu\u00e9 es lo que hacemos en la comunidad, a qu\u00e9 nos dedicamos. Vamos a compartir nuestro nombre, otra vez, el nombre que usted prefiere para poder crear este espacio de di\u00e1logo, y adem\u00e1s de nuestro nombre vamos a decir d\u00f3nde vivimos, a qu\u00e9 nos dedicamos, y un valor que sea importante para usted. Puede ser lo que sea. Un valor puede ser honestidad, respeto, lo que a usted se le venga a la mente cuando usted piense en un valor que sea bien importante para usted. Entonces, voy a comenzar por m\u00ed y voy a presentarme. Mi nombre es Mar\u00eda Cornejo, directora del Elmhurst Community Partnership o Coalici\u00f3n Comunitaria de Elmhurst. Adem\u00e1s de eso soy residente de Queens, muy amante de Corona, de mi comunidad de Corona, aqu\u00ed viv\u00ed por muchos a\u00f1os, y de Jackson Heights. Vivo actualmente en Rego Park. Y un valor importante para m\u00ed es el respeto, es un valor muy importante para m\u00ed. Vamos a comenzar con Marta.", "386": "Buenas tardes, mi nombre es Marta S\u00e1nchez. Tengo casi 12 a\u00f1os en la comunidad, siempre he sido activista y una luchadora por las escuelas p\u00fablicas. He sido una mam\u00e1 que participa en todo. Y tiene aproximadamente un a\u00f1o que me integr\u00e9 a Elmhurst Community Partnership, pues ahora tambi\u00e9n soy parte del grupo de las embajadoras de ECP. Yo vivo en Corona. Y el valor que yo voy a decir es-- mi palabra es poder, el poder. Creo que eso es todo, \u00bfMar\u00eda Paula?", "387": "Gracias, Marta. Gladys.", "388": "Mi nombre es Gladys Coloma. Yo soy vecina de Jackson Heights. Tambi\u00e9n he pertenecido a Corona, y soy embajadora de la organizaci\u00f3n Elmhurst Community Partnership. Trabajo ayudando a la comunidad en mi grupo, es un grupo de liderazgo muy fuerte con todas las embajadoras. Y tambi\u00e9n trabajo en la organizaci\u00f3n Se Hace Camino Nueva York desde el 2014, estoy en el programa de [foreign], y ah\u00ed ayudo a todos los casos de inmigraci\u00f3n con la organizaci\u00f3n Catholic Charities. Y el mayor valor para m\u00ed yo creo que es la vida.", "389": "Gracias, Gladys.", "390": "Le paso el micr\u00f3fono a Tania.", "391": "S\u00ed. Est\u00e1s en mute, Tania [risas].", "392": "Buenas tardes, ni nombre es Tania Cunvico. Desde que llegu\u00e9 a este pa\u00eds he vivido aqu\u00ed en Elmhurst, soy embajadora de ECP. Y un valor que para m\u00ed es muy importante es la amabilidad.", "393": "Gracias, Tania. \u00bfMayra?", "394": "Hola, buenas tardes, mi nombre es Mayra Callo, yo vivo en el vecindario de Jackson Heights. Soy una embajadora de la comunidad tambi\u00e9n, trabajo para Elmhurst Community Partnership, y tambi\u00e9n para la organizaci\u00f3n Se Hace Camino Nueva York, soy supervisora del censo. Y un valor muy importante para m\u00ed es la solidaridad.", "395": "Wao, s\u00ed, estoy de acuerdo. Gracias, Mayra. Seguimos con Esmeralda.", "396": "Hola, mi nombre es Esmeralda Gonz\u00e1lez. Pr\u00e1cticamente desde que llegu\u00e9 a este pa\u00eds yo viv\u00eda en Jackson Heights, me cas\u00e9 y me mud\u00e9 a Elmhurst, y ahorita estoy en un East Elmhurst. Soy la coordinadora administrativa de ECP, tambi\u00e9n particip\u00e9 como embajadora comunitaria, soy del comit\u00e9 de la escuela de mis ni\u00f1os. Y un valor para m\u00ed tambi\u00e9n es la solidaridad, \u00bfpor qu\u00e9? Porque creo que si nos apoyamos unos a otros podemos salir adelante, podemos ser mejores personas.", "397": "Estoy de acuerdo, gracias, Esmeralda. \u00bfLucero?", "398": "Hola, soy Lucero, soy embajadora de Elmhurst Community Partnership. Radico en la zona de Corona, y mi valor es la honestidad y amor a lo que uno hace. Amo ser parte de este grupo, Elmhurst Community Partnership.", "399": "Gracias, Lucero. Muchas gracias a todas por participar otra vez hoy d\u00eda y por presentarse. Creo que es muy importante que la gente conozca su historia y el gran trabajo que cada una de ustedes est\u00e1 haciendo. No solamente afuera y en todos los roles que ustedes se desempe\u00f1an, pero tambi\u00e9n en sus casas, siendo madres, siendo l\u00edderes en sus hogares. Entonces, les agradezco mucho por el tiempo que nos prestan. Vamos a transicionar a lo siguiente y nos gustar\u00eda invitar a compartir sobre nosotros un poquito m\u00e1s, dado que hoy el tema es: \"Salud y bienestar\". Ese es el tema principal. Nos gustar\u00eda invitarlos a que tomen un minuto y piensen c\u00f3mo se sienten con relaci\u00f3n a su salud y bienestar. Y bienestar podemos identificar, de pronto, definir bienestar de diferentes maneras, pero cuando yo pienso en bienestar, siempre me enfoco en nuestra salud mental, el bienestar de nosotras internamente. Vamos a tomarnos un minutico para meditar de c\u00f3mo nos sentimos en relaci\u00f3n a nuestra salud y bienestar.", "400": "[silencio]", "401": "Mientras estamos meditando en esas dos palabras \"salud y bienestar\", vamos luego a pensar en un momento, lugar o historia, en la que se sinti\u00f3 que estaba en su mejor momento en t\u00e9rminos de salud y bienestar. En su mejor momento, que usted pueda decir: \"Yo estaba bien en t\u00e9rminos de salud, mi salud mental y bienestar\". Algunas preguntas que quiero que ustedes contesten cuando est\u00e9n pensando en esto. \u00bfQu\u00e9 puedes recordar acerca de sobre c\u00f3mo te sentiste y por qu\u00e9 cuando estabas en tu mejor momento?, \u00bfqu\u00e9 puedes recordar acerca de eso? \u00bfCu\u00e1les fueron algunos de los factores que respaldaron o ayudaron a tu salud y bienestar en ese momento cuando te sentiste en lo mejor? \u00bfCu\u00e1les fueron algunos de esos factores que te ayudaron?, \u00bfc\u00f3mo te sentiste? Vamos a hacer otra vez una ronda, pero antes de esto recorreremos una a la vez, para compartir nuestra historia, y recuerden que esto ser\u00e1 grabado, por lo que le pedimos que no divulguen ninguna informaci\u00f3n confidencial de su salud personal, ni utilice los nombres de otras personas cuando cuenten sus historias. Como siempre, me gustar\u00eda empezar para dar un ejemplo, y cualquier cosa aqu\u00ed estoy para contestar sus preguntas, \u00bfbueno? Voy a empezar. \u00bfQu\u00e9 puedo recordar de cuando me sent\u00ed lo mejor? Puedo recordar que estaba en un espacio de paz, no me sent\u00eda cargada. A veces cuando mi salud mental no est\u00e1 bien, me siento pesada mentalmente, me siento como que tengo un mont\u00f3n de cosas encima de m\u00ed y que no puedo como respirar a veces. Me siento ansiosa. Entonces, cuando me siento de lo mejor me siento feliz, me siento libre. Tambi\u00e9n me siento bien f\u00edsicamente. Siento que a veces cuando no estoy bien, me enfermo, y puedo contar las veces que me he enfermado, y siempre lo atribuyo a que no estoy bien en mi salud mental, o estoy bien estresada por algo de trabajo o en mi hogar, o en la escuela o lo que sea. Y siento que estoy en mi mejor momento cuando estoy haciendo ejercicio, alguno de los factores que me respaldan a sentirme bien, cuando tengo una rutina, cuando me siento como estructurada, porque es parte de mi personalidad. Digo: \"Okay, este va a ser tiempo de trabajo, este va a ser un tiempo para mi familia, este va a ser un tiempo para m\u00ed\". Entonces, ya sea hacer un ejercicio de ir a caminar a mi perro, o sea ir al parque a jugar con mi ahijada, o sea algo f\u00edsico, ir afuera y coger sol, eso siempre me respalda mi salud. Tambi\u00e9n cuando tengo conversaciones con mis familiares o personas a quien amo, siento que me ayuda a mi salud mental, cuando tengo la oportunidad de sentarme y hablar de cosas que de pronto me incomodan o momentos tristes, o si me estoy empezando a sentir un poquito ansiosa, le comparto a mi esposo en ese caso, que vive conmigo, y eso me ayuda mucho tambi\u00e9n. Entonces, vamos a cada una contar nuestra historia. Voy a poner las preguntas, r\u00e1pidamente, si gustan. Voy a poner las preguntas en el chat, por si quieren referencia. Vamos a comenzar con Marta. Est\u00e1s en mute, Marta.", "402": "Yo creo que yo me he sentido bien cuando estoy aqu\u00ed en la casa, estar un momento a solas como para meditar. Por ejemplo, a veces los ni\u00f1os est\u00e1n en la escuela o mi esposo est\u00e1 trabajando, y a veces yo siempre estoy en la calle, pero hay veces que tengo la oportunidad de estar en la casa. La verdad que s\u00ed me gusta porque como que te sientes un poquito con privacidad, y escucho la m\u00fasica que yo quiero, me gusta. Puedo tal vez escuchar un audio. Siento como m\u00e1s espacio para yo hacer mis cosas, limpiar y todo; como bien dice: \"Hogar, dulce hogar\". Y siempre yo dec\u00eda: \"Quiero que mis hijos est\u00e9n aqu\u00ed conmigo porque todos siempre andamos en la calle, mi esposo trabajando, mis hijos en la escuela y todo, y mira, en estos momentos todos estamos ac\u00e1 juntos reunidos\". La otra cosa de c\u00f3mo yo me siento a veces como bien, c\u00f3mo me siento de mis sentimientos o que disfruto algo es la naturaleza. A m\u00ed me encanta bastante la naturaleza, me gusta ir a un lugar alejado donde no haya carros, ruido, y simplemente pues apreciar todo lo que est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed en este mundo, en la vida. Para m\u00ed la naturaleza es algo maravilloso, me encanta, me encanta mucho la naturaleza. Cuando me siento as\u00ed como que estoy un poquito estresada es cuando, por ejemplo, a veces que ya uno tiene que estar pensando en que ya viene que pagar los servicios, que la renta, todo eso. Entonces, eso como que ah\u00ed me pongo un poquito preocupada y nerviosa. Eso es lo que puedo contar.", "403": "Gracias, Gladys.", "404": "Marta.", "405": "Perd\u00f3n, Marta, continuamos con Gladys.", "406": "Bueno, ahora me toca a m\u00ed [risas]. Bueno, para recordar los mejores momentos que yo he podido tener en mi vida, yo pienso que el mejor momento m\u00edo fue cuando yo era hija y era estudiante. Cuando yo era hija y era estudiante, pues yo no ten\u00eda responsabilidades, m\u00e1s que estudiar. Y los que eran responsables de todo, del trabajo, de la comida y de todas las cosas eran mis padres. Incluso, mantenerme en la escuela. Tambi\u00e9n era muy bonito y eran mis mejores momentos, porque yo pod\u00eda tener las amigas que yo quer\u00eda, pod\u00eda jugar v\u00f3ley, hacer mucho deporte, bailar mucho. Llegu\u00e9 a ense\u00f1ar baile, en alg\u00fan momento fui directora de un ballet de baile. Viajaba mucho bailando y siempre iba con mi mam\u00e1 a todo lugar, muy orgullosa de que era mi mam\u00e1. Era la mam\u00e1 de todo el grupo, porque todos la quer\u00edan. Y siempre me recog\u00eda en el carro y llev\u00e1bamos a todo el grupo, todos iban felices porque era la mam\u00e1 de todos los compa\u00f1eros. Y pues, las fiestas familiares, el amor que se vive en nuestro pa\u00eds, que a veces ac\u00e1 es como medio fr\u00edo. Las fiestas navide\u00f1as que regocijan mucho, y el amor que se da para Dios, que se ora en la comida. Y que esos momentos que yo pude vivir a veces no se repiten, ya no vuelven, pero s\u00ed quedan bien grabados, como empoder\u00e1ndote, de que la vida y la creaci\u00f3n que los padres tuvieron hacia uno es muy bonito, es muy importante. Y eso fue lo m\u00e1s bonito que yo he podido vivir, aparte, de tener a mis hijas. Cuando ellas nacieron fue algo muy, muy, muy hermoso para m\u00ed. Gracias.", "407": "Gracias, Gladys. \u00bfTania?", "408": "Bueno, algo que yo recuerdo, para m\u00ed, yo puedo decir que esta pandemia nos ha ayudado a valorar la libertad, pues ya que ahora tenemos que seguir reglas y es algo muy diferente. Lo que hago para mantenerme bien, en salud y mentalmente, es hacer ejercicios, ir a lugares que sean despejados, que haya \u00e1rboles, r\u00edos. Me gusta mucho estar ah\u00ed. Me siento m\u00e1s tranquila. Siento que estoy fuera de lo que es una rutina, estar aqu\u00ed en la cuidad. Tambi\u00e9n me ayuda mucho charlar con amigos, amigas, de lo que uno siente o lo que uno piensa. Nos ayuda a desahogar. Porque ya que el hecho que uno vive con una pareja no es lo mismo, es diferente interactuar con tus amigos. Es una relaci\u00f3n diferente que uno tiene como m\u00e1s libertad de expresar lo que uno realmente piensa. Eso es todo.", "409": "Gracias, Tania. \u00bfMayra?", "410": "\u00bfMe escuchas? \u00bfS\u00ed me escuchan?", "411": "S\u00ed, te escuchamos.", "412": "Okay. La pregunta fue: \"\u00bfC\u00f3mo te sientes? \u00bfC\u00f3mo puedes recordar tu mejor momento?\" Sin duda, creo que todos vamos a coincidir en lo que yo voy a decir, espero. Mi mejor momento para m\u00ed siempre fue la conexi\u00f3n que yo tuve con el mar, \u00bfno? La libertad que uno ten\u00eda de poderse escapar un rato a la playa. No s\u00e9 mis compa\u00f1eras, pero yo siempre he sentido como que en el mar uno tiene paz. La libertad de poder sentirse as\u00ed, sin duda, tambi\u00e9n el nacimiento de mi hija fue uno de los mejores momentos que yo he podido vivir. Pero para mi salud mental, para mi bienestar, me encanta ir a la playa. Me fascina ir al playa. Puedo estar todo el d\u00eda metida ah\u00ed y eso me hace sentir muy bien.", "413": "Cuando dices que te hace sentir muy bien, \u00bfqu\u00e9 sentimientos te trae?", "414": "Paz. A m\u00ed me da mucha paz y mucha sanaci\u00f3n. Cuando yo tengo mucho estr\u00e9s o tengo problemas, siempre me ha gustado-- mi pap\u00e1 es de la costa en mi pa\u00eds, as\u00ed que siempre he tenido la oportunidad de meterme al mar porque tenemos una casa all\u00e1. Y eso me hace mucha falta ahora, porque yo creo que en estos momentos todas las personas tenemos como que mucho estr\u00e9s y muchos sentimientos encontrados por lo que est\u00e1 pasando en la actualidad, en nuestra comunidad y en nuestros vecindarios. Es una salida.", "415": "Gracias. \u00bfEsmeralda?", "416": "Yo creo que durante el proceso de mi vida, en mis a\u00f1os he tenido o he experimentado varios momentos de felicidad. Uno muy especial para m\u00ed fue hace un a\u00f1o, cuando volv\u00ed a ver a mi abuelita despu\u00e9s de 20 a\u00f1os, porque era una conexi\u00f3n muy grande la que yo ten\u00eda con ella. Yo cre\u00ed que no iba a pasar, por todo lo que vivimos como inmigrantes en este pa\u00eds. Ella tuvo la oportunidad de venir a verme y la disfrut\u00e9 mucho. Ya van dos veces que ella viene a verme. Durante medio a\u00f1o la disfruto, disfruto estar con ella. Creo que uno regresa a esa etapa cuando era uno peque\u00f1a y ellos cuidaban de uno. Y ahora me toca a m\u00ed hacer esa parte de peinarla, de abrazarla, de taparla, de cubrirla, y eso para m\u00ed me hace muy feliz. Y me hace muy feliz porque le transmito ese sentimiento a mis hijos. Mis hijos no la conoc\u00edan, pero siempre me escuchaban hablar de ella y ellos la trataron con mucho cari\u00f1o, la cuidaban, la agarraban de la mano para sentarse. Eso me provoc\u00f3 mucha felicidad, yo creo que es una de las partes de mi vida que me ha provocado mucha felicidad, el agradecimiento por volverla a ver, por tenerla cerca. Y algo que me hace sentirme bien en todo esto, porque yo tengo tres hijos [risas] y tengo que estar bien para que ellos puedan estar bien, porque si yo no estoy bien ellos tampoco est\u00e1n bien. Entonces, hay momentos de ansiedad, hay momentos de frustraci\u00f3n, hay momentos de pensar qu\u00e9 est\u00e1 pasando con nuestra comunidad. Y a m\u00ed me funciona mucho cuando estoy ba\u00f1\u00e1ndome sentir el agua [risas], sentir el agua que corre, eso a m\u00ed me tranquiliza mucho, sentir el agua, y caminar con ellos. Y eso es.", "417": "Gracias, Esmeralda, qu\u00e9 lindo. Lucero.", "418": "Hola, yo no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 decir. Esos momentos no puedo explicarlos. No puedo, Mar\u00eda Paula.", "419": "Bien, te podemos dar un momento, no te preocupes. Ahorita podemos--", "420": "Bueno, a m\u00ed lo que me hace inmensamente feliz son mis tres hijos. En estos momentos estoy pasando una situaci\u00f3n dif\u00edcil, pero lo que me da mucha fortaleza es haber descubierto que ten\u00eda personas maravillosas a mi lado, que sin conocerme-- una de ellas me est\u00e1 escuchando-- que sin conocerme a fondo supo desde el primer instante lo que yo ten\u00eda y me ha ayudado, como no tienes idea, y me ha ayudado a salir adelante. Mi mayor felicidad son definitivamente mis hijos y tambi\u00e9n que mi mam\u00e1 est\u00e9 aqu\u00ed de visita. No se ha podido ir por la situaci\u00f3n. Y cuando estoy deprimida, triste, me ayuda mucho acercarme a esa persona que me est\u00e1 escuchando ahorita [risas]. Te quiero, Esme. Mis ni\u00f1os, abrazarlos y rezar. En estos momentos, el rezar, el estar cerca de Dios, la fe, estar cerca de mis hijos, cada momento me ha ayudado a salir adelante. Y pues ya, quisiera decir m\u00e1s, pero no puedo, pero lo intent\u00e9.", "421": "Muchas gracias, muchas gracias Lucero por compartir eso. A todas ustedes much\u00edsimas gracias. Creo que lo que resalta mucho es la familia, somos una cultura de familia, de tener a nuestros hijos, nuestros seres queridos cerca. Y creo que es nost\u00e1lgico a veces, como inmigrantes que somos, no tener a toda nuestra familia cerca de nosotros. Y eso es uno de los retos, y tambi\u00e9n bendiciones cuando los tenemos ah\u00ed. Qu\u00e9 rico que tu mam\u00e1 est\u00e9 aqu\u00ed contigo, Lucero. Tambi\u00e9n, a veces vivimos en una ciudad bien sobrepoblada, y poder retirarnos un poquito y ver el aire fresco y el mar, el campo, escuchar los pajaritos, tambi\u00e9n nos trae mucha paz interior. Entonces, me pone muy nost\u00e1lgica escucharla a todas ustedes. Muchas gracias.", "422": "Vamos a pasar a la siguiente faceta, que va relacionado con el tema que estamos hablando, pero nos vamos a enfocar en nuestra comunidad. Ahora s\u00ed que vamos a hablar de la comunidad donde vivimos. Queremos pasar esta conversaci\u00f3n a hablar sobre nuestras esperanzas, tambi\u00e9n preocupaciones que tenemos sobre la salud y el bienestar de nuestra comunidad. Para el prop\u00f3sito de esta conversaci\u00f3n les invito a pensar en la comunidad en general, a compartir sobre su vecindario. Puede ser donde vive, puede ser [inaudible] usted piense, lo general. Lucero, si te puedes poner en mute, por favor. Tambi\u00e9n podemos, en t\u00e9rminos de nuestra vida social, eso tambi\u00e9n es comunidad. Hablaban muchas de ustedes, y comparto ese sentimiento, cuando estamos con familia o inclusive amigos, personas cercanas que han tocado nuestras vidas y que nos ayudan a veces y se convierten en familia, ese c\u00edrculo social que tenemos a nuestro alrededor. Tambi\u00e9n podemos pensar en eso cuando contestemos estas preguntas. Y vamos a hablar tambi\u00e9n de nuestra experiencia relacionada con una comunidad en particular. Comparta en qu\u00e9 comunidad est\u00e1 pensando cuando comparte su historia. Si est\u00e1 pensando en Corona o en Elmhurst o donde usted vive, o en su v\u00ednculo social, por favor aclare para que podamos realmente entender el contexto de su historia.", "423": "Tenemos algunas preguntas para comenzar, pero esperemos que sea el momento, otra vez, de participaci\u00f3n din\u00e1mica, donde todas compartamos nuestra historia, y vamos a responder a los puntos que de pronto resaltan de la historia de cada una. Si algo le resalt\u00f3 de la historia de una persona en espec\u00edfico, hablemos de eso, porque a veces esa conexi\u00f3n es importante, resaltar y dejar saber que compartimos ese sentimiento. Voy a hacer la siguiente pregunta: \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que est\u00e1 funcionado bien en su comunidad para apoyar su salud y bienestar? \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que est\u00e1 funcionando en su comunidad? \u00bfCu\u00e1les son algunas de las personas, lugares o cosas que han contribuido positivamente a su salud y bienestar o los de su comunidad? Vamos a compartir una historia, de pronto un relato de nuestra experiencia, para entendernos un poquito m\u00e1s. O cuando estamos hablando, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es lo que ha funcionado en su comunidad donde usted vive actualmente? Voy otra vez, voy a poner esta pregunta en el chat para que usted use como referencia. Entonces, vamos a tomarnos unos diez segunditos para pensar bien esta pregunta y darle oportunidad, por ejemplo, a Marta, que yo s\u00e9 que ahorita va a contestar. Vamos a meditar un poquito.", "424": "Mientras ustedes meditan voy a agregar la siguiente pregunta. Cuando meditemos de lo que est\u00e1 funcionando para el bienestar de nosotros en nuestra comunidad, \u00bfqu\u00e9 estamos aprendiendo sobre el bienestar y la resiliencia de nuestra comunidad en esta pandemia que tambi\u00e9n le gustar\u00eda que otros entiendan? Podemos contestar esta pregunta separado. Vamos a tratar de que cada pregunta la contestemos, de pronto, en menos de un minuto, para que tengamos la oportunidad de contestar la siguiente pregunta. Marta, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es lo que est\u00e1 funcionando en tu comunidad para apoyar tu salud y bienestar?", "425": "Bueno, yo quisiera pensar solamente en mi comunidad, pero no, no es posible. Es bien dif\u00edcil ahorita decir, para mi salud, que est\u00e9 funcionando algo. Estoy ahorita todav\u00eda tratando de pensar, porque ser\u00eda-- puede ser que las reuniones ahorita de Zoom, la educaci\u00f3n, que ahorita estamos d\u00e1ndole uso a la tecnolog\u00eda. Eso. No s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 otra cosa ser\u00eda, la verdad que es muy dif\u00edcil, estoy pensando todav\u00eda. No s\u00e9, a lo mejor que las compa\u00f1eras tienen un poquito m\u00e1s tiempo de pensar, pero es bien dif\u00edcil, la verdad. Es bien dif\u00edcil porque todas las familias est\u00e1n en casa, sabemos muy bien que vivimos en lugares muy reducidos. Toda la familia est\u00e1 adentro, y pues no tenemos espacios como para ir y sentarnos, o tener un jard\u00edn y tal vez pensar, reflexionar. Pero ahorita solamente yo creo que es la tecnolog\u00eda, no ver tantas noticias, escuchar m\u00e1s audios. Tal vez un poquito m\u00e1s de m\u00fasica. Eso es lo que yo pienso.", "426": "Gracias, Marta. Estoy de acuerdo, totalmente. S\u00e9 me olvid\u00f3 contestar la pregunta [risas] a m\u00ed tambi\u00e9n, y la quiero contestar. Y si quieres a\u00f1adir algo, Marta, en el transcurso de cuando otra est\u00e9 participando, por favor, cuando t\u00fa quieras. Algo que est\u00e1 funcionando en mi comunidad para apoyar mi salud y bienestar, estoy de acuerdo con Marta en el sentido de que, en estos tiempos, no mucho de pronto por todo lo que est\u00e1 pasando, pero creo que para m\u00ed la identidad cultural de la comunidad de Corona y Jackson Heights es algo que a\u00f1oro mucho. Por lo que yo crec\u00ed fuera de mi pa\u00eds, aunque nac\u00ed en mi pa\u00eds por muchos a\u00f1os y viv\u00ed ah\u00ed-- nac\u00ed en mi pa\u00eds y viv\u00ed por algunos a\u00f1os, he vivido muchos a\u00f1os en Nueva York, y siempre he tenido ese conflicto de identidad, que no s\u00e9 si comparten conmigo, o de pronto sus hijos que han nacido aqu\u00ed. Siento que parte de mi est\u00e1 en Colombia, de donde yo soy, parte de m\u00ed es de aqu\u00ed. Y a veces me da mucha nostalgia de no poder ir a visitar a mi pa\u00eds y a mi familia que est\u00e1 all\u00e1. Algo que ha funcionado y que me ayuda, digamos, en no sentirme tan triste de no poder estar en mi pa\u00eds, es cuando paso por Jackson Heights y veo las panader\u00edas colombianas, o veo a las personas hablando espa\u00f1ol y compartiendo un almuerzo y viendo un partido de f\u00fatbol, o que el vecino est\u00e9 habl\u00e1ndole a otro vecino, el vecino est\u00e1 vendiendo salchipapas y arepas. Siento un sentido de comunidad y me siento como que no estoy tan lejos de mi cultura, no estoy tan lejos, que puedo tener aunque sea un poquitico de mi cultura aqu\u00ed. Tambi\u00e9n las cosas que han contribuido, siento que mi comunidad, a pesar de lo que sea, nos cuidamos el uno al otro; si estoy en un problema o si me siento triste, o inclusive si algo me falta. Yo crec\u00ed con una madre soltera donde hubo muchos momentos dif\u00edciles, financieramente y de otras cosas, y su c\u00edrculo de comunidad, que se ha convertido en el m\u00edo, nunca nos dej\u00f3. Siento que, aunque de pronto el sistema gubernamental o lo que sea, no estuvo ah\u00ed siempre para apoyarnos, siento que la comunidad y el sentido de familia aqu\u00ed con personas que no son familia de sangre, pero que se convirtieron as\u00ed, en los momentos m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles siempre han estado ah\u00ed. Entonces, eso s\u00ed lo tengo que atribuir a mi comunidad. Y hablo de mi comunidad de Corona porque yo crec\u00ed-- mi ni\u00f1ez fue en esa comunidad. Quiero resaltar esa parte. Marta.", "427": "S\u00ed. Lo que s\u00ed he visto que ha funcionado en mi comunidad, la verdad que s\u00ed, son los grupos. Las coaliciones, organizaciones, equipos, esos s\u00ed, eso s\u00ed es algo muy bueno; porque las coaliciones, los grupos, las organizaciones, hasta el momento son ellos los que han estado apoyando a la comunidad. Esos solamente.", "428": "Gracias, Marta. \u00bfGladys? Voy a hacer la pregunta otra vez, para las que de pronto no escucharon la primera vez. \u00bfQu\u00e9 es lo que est\u00e1 funcionando bien en su comunidad para apoyar a su salud y bienestar? \u00bfCu\u00e1les son las personas, lugares o cosas que han contribuido a su salud y bienestar positivamente en su comunidad? \u00bfGladys?", "429": "Okay. Para m\u00ed, yo creo que lo que est\u00e1 funcionando para mejorar la salud ha sido la relaci\u00f3n de los servicios m\u00faltiples que han tenido todas las organizaciones, como por ejemplo, Elmhurst Community Partnership y todas las organizaciones en conjunto, han sido un punto fundamental para toda la comunidad en general. Los servicios de salud, los servicios de food pantry, los servicios de asesor\u00edas legales, y todo eso gratuitamente. Y tambi\u00e9n las ayudas para las personas que han estado enfermas, ayudas para las personas que han fallecido, eso ha hecho de que esta comunidad pueda estar organizada en s\u00ed. Porque si no hubieran existido estas comunidades, como las organizaciones, yo pienso que esto hubiera sido m\u00e1s complejo. Tambi\u00e9n considero que todas las personas que trabajan en lo que es trabajadoras sociales han sido fundamentales para que pueda salir adelante toda nuestra comunidad, y sobre todo, aliviar a la salud mental de las personas, porque eso ha hecho sentir a las personas que no est\u00e1n solas. Las llamadas de tel\u00e9fono de todas las personas que hacemos en nuestra comunidad, como el trabajo que estamos haciendo cada semana. La organizaci\u00f3n en las escuelas, que fue inmediata, para que los alumnos puedan tener su material para estudiar remotamente. El idioma tambi\u00e9n, porque antiguamente el idioma no funcionaba para nadie. A uno le pod\u00edan estar abriendo el coraz\u00f3n, pero el paciente no sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 le iba a hacer el m\u00e9dico. Dec\u00edan: \"Esto es United States\" y usted ten\u00eda que hablar ingl\u00e9s como sea, y no le hac\u00edan lo que quer\u00edan en su cuerpo y eso causaba tambi\u00e9n como una falta de identidad para las personas, y tambi\u00e9n frustraci\u00f3n. Pienso que ahora, como es legal, incluso para poder trabajar ya no solo le piden el ingl\u00e9s, sino se ha legalizado ya el idioma espa\u00f1ol. En cualquier lugar usted puede hablar su idioma, puede exigir legalmente que le hablen su idioma, porque si no le hablan su idioma est\u00e1n atropellando y es tambi\u00e9n, \u00bfc\u00f3mo le puedo decir? Es una discriminaci\u00f3n cuando no le est\u00e1n hablando su idioma y eso funciona porque eso trae salud mental. Cuando uno est\u00e1 en una reuni\u00f3n y no entiende el idioma, se va frustrado y siente que estuvo perdiendo el tiempo en una reuni\u00f3n donde no entendi\u00f3 nada. Eso es muy importante porque ahora las personas pueden ser aceptadas, incluso en trabajos, por hablar el idioma espa\u00f1ol, que deber\u00eda ser universal. Pues esas son mis ideas y muchas gracias.", "430": "Gracias Gladys, tienes toda la raz\u00f3n. \u00bfTania?", "431": "Lo que yo siento que me ha ayudado en la comunidad-- Bueno, como dijo Marta, en estos momentos no es mucho, pero lo que s\u00ed pienso que el saber que hay organizaciones que est\u00e1n cuidando de todo lo de nuestra comunidad, que ser\u00eda Jackson Heights, Corona, eso da un alivio, tanto como personal y a nivel de la comunidad. El saber que hay personas que, a pesar que est\u00e1n exponiendo sus propias vidas para ayudar a otras personas, habla mucho de esa persona. Y siento que antes de que pasara todo esto, algo que a m\u00ed me ha ayudado en lo personal, es cuando uno llega del pa\u00eds de uno y llega ac\u00e1 y ve todo mundo, la mayor\u00eda habla espa\u00f1ol, eso a uno le llena, eso de saber de que, a pesar que estamos en Estados Unidos podemos hablar nuestro propio idioma, encontrar nuestra comida; de Ecuador, Colombia, de M\u00e9xico. Es algo muy bonito. Y estoy hablando en lo general, es lo que ser\u00eda Queens.", "432": "S\u00ed, definitivamente. Gracias Tania. \u00bfMayra?", "433": "Okay. Sin duda lo que me hace sentir que mi comunidad est\u00e1 funcionando bien, sin duda es la labor social que est\u00e1n haciendo las organizaciones, muchas personas que est\u00e1n haciendo voluntariado, asamble\u00edstas, personas que, sin esperar nada a cambio, se preocupan por el bienestar del vecino, de la vecina, si se encuentra bien, si tiene pa\u00f1ales. Uno de ellos somos, creo, nosotros, que nos hemos estado preocupando por el bienestar de las dem\u00e1s personas y de nuestro vecindario. Yo tambi\u00e9n he sido una beneficiaria de eso con mi beb\u00e9, como yo tengo una bebita, entonces, eso me parece que est\u00e1 funcionando muy bien en mi comunidad. Ahora, de hecho, que s\u00ed es impresionante vivir en un \u00e1rea como en donde yo vivo, que es en Jackson Heights, porque ac\u00e1 uno se siente como en casa. Lo que dicen mis compa\u00f1eras es completamente cierto, si uno sale a la esquina uno va a encontrar un restaurante colombiano que hace cafecito, y uno se siente como a gusto. Pero debo resaltar mucho la labor social que estamos haciendo todos en conjunto, estamos demostrando que m\u00e1s que latinos, nosotros estamos todos juntos en estos momentos para apoyarnos.", "434": "Claro que s\u00ed, gracias Mayra. \u00bfEsmeralda?", "435": "Bueno, yo creo que en estos tiempos vuelvo a la primera pregunta, y es la solidaridad que tenemos los unos a los otros. Eso que nos hacer ser diferentes, en Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, es que estamos ah\u00ed unos para los otros, aunque no tengamos lo suficiente, creo que compartimos lo poquito que tenemos hacia los dem\u00e1s. Y creo que ECP ha hecho un gran trabajo en estos momentos donde la comunidad perdi\u00f3 trabajos, perdi\u00f3 familias, perdi\u00f3 muchas cosas, pero tenemos esa solidaridad de estar unidas. Todas trabajamos en equipo, unas por riesgo desde su casa, otras saliendo a ver c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 nuestra comunidad, porque, aunque hay mucha resiliencia entre nosotras, hay momento que eso se baja. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque no hay trabajos, porque nuestras familias necesitan comida, porque creo que los primeros meses ten\u00edamos la esperanza de que pasara r\u00e1pido, ahora que han pasado los meses y vemos que es el momento en que m\u00e1s necesitamos de solidaridad de todas las organizaciones, de todas las personas que est\u00e1n ah\u00ed, y que creo que lo \u00fanico que podemos hacer es ayudarnos mutuamente, estar ah\u00ed unos para los otros. Y al igual que muchas de ustedes, yo tambi\u00e9n viene a este pa\u00eds cuando ten\u00eda-- bueno, yo vine m\u00e1s grande, cuando ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1os, entrar a una escuela me hizo pasar por muchas cosas. El primer a\u00f1o yo le dec\u00eda a mi mam\u00e1 que ya yo no quer\u00eda ir a la escuela por el idioma, y mi mam\u00e1 se ten\u00eda que sentar conmigo a traducir la tarea con un diccionario, y ella me dec\u00eda que iba a pasar y que yo iba a poder. Siempre ha estado ah\u00ed detr\u00e1s de m\u00ed mi mam\u00e1, y creo que como latinas eso es lo que somos, las que tenemos hijos ahora estamos ah\u00ed detr\u00e1s de nuestros hijos para que ellos sientan nuestro apoyo. Pero creo que, en lo personal, lo que yo trato de demostrarle a mis hijos o ense\u00f1arles es que siempre volteen a su alrededor. Ellos tuvieron la bendici\u00f3n de nacer en este pa\u00eds y hablan un ingl\u00e9s perfecto, pero yo siempre les digo a los dos m\u00e1s grandes, que son los que ya tienen un poquito m\u00e1s de capacidad de entender, que siempre que vean que alguien nuevo llega a la escuela sean esa mano que alguna vez alguien fue conmigo, esa mano de ayuda, y a ellos ahora les toca ayudar. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque llegan ni\u00f1os a esa edad a sus escuelas y se tienen que adaptar a un nuevo pa\u00eds, a un nuevo sistema, a un nuevo idioma, a una nueva escuela. En nuestros pa\u00edses hay m\u00e1s libertad en las escuelas, aqu\u00ed es todo adentro, todo en un building. Entonces, creo que siempre le he dicho a mi hija especialmente que sea esa mano, esa mano que necesiten otros para caminar juntos, no que sea esa parte que tambi\u00e9n existe en este pa\u00eds que discrimina o que se burla de ti. Porque creo que si todos nos unimos y nos apoyamos, el mundo ser\u00e1 mejor siempre.", "436": "Claro que s\u00ed. Gracias, Esme. \u00bfLucero? \u00bfLucero?", "437": "Hola, perd\u00f3n. Yo creo que lo mismo que dice Esmeralda, lo que est\u00e1 funcionando para mi salud mental es eso, los grupos de apoyo, y que con esa pandemia hemos aprendido como a ayudarnos unos con otros. Entonces, eso nos ha ense\u00f1ado a ser m\u00e1s humanos entre nosotros, en que si yo tengo una informaci\u00f3n y se la comparto a otra persona, y as\u00ed, como una cadenita, y as\u00ed nos vamos ayudando mutuamente. Y como dijo Martita, tambi\u00e9n la tecnolog\u00eda ha hecho mucho para que nosotros tambi\u00e9n tengamos ayuda a manos llenas. Y l\u00f3gico, ECP, Elmhurst Community Partnership, ha sido una parte fundamental para nuestra comunidad. De hecho, ayer est\u00e1bamos trabajando en la-- fue nuestro \u00faltimo d\u00eda en la iglesia, yo sent\u00ed hermoso, yo soy muy cursi, ya sabes [risas]. Llegaron dos madres de familia y se acercaron a J\u00e9ssica y a m\u00ed, y nos dijeron que si nos pod\u00edan tomar una foto, que porque ellas han acudido a varias organizaciones donde nunca hab\u00edan sido tan amables con ellos como lo hab\u00edamos sido nosotros, y siempre las veces que ellas acudieron ah\u00ed a la iglesia, siempre se les recib\u00eda con una sonrisa y con amabilidad. Entonces me dicen: \"\u00bfUstedes ser\u00e1 que nos podr\u00e1n dejar tomarles una foto para llamar a las noticias 41, 47 y decirles que ustedes son la mejor organizaci\u00f3n de la cual nosotros hemos recibido mucha ayuda y estamos felices?\"; yo la verdad sent\u00ed padr\u00edsimo escuchar eso. Yo le compart\u00ed a J\u00e9ssica, y las se\u00f1oras nos dijeron: \"Que Dios las bendiga\", y fue un momento para m\u00ed hermoso. Entonces, creo que hemos aprendido eso, a ser m\u00e1s humanos, y a ayudarnos entre nosotros como dijo Esmeralda. Y ya eso es todo.", "438": "Gracias, Lucero. Y la \u00faltima pregunta antes de terminar nuestra conversaci\u00f3n por hoy, y que puse tambi\u00e9n ah\u00ed es: \u00bfQu\u00e9 hemos aprendido--? y creo que varias lo contestamos de una u otra manera, pero, \u00bfqu\u00e9 hemos aprendido sobre el bienestar y la resiliencia de nuestra comunidad en esta pandemia que te gustar\u00eda que otros entiendan? Y puedes compartir por medio de una historia, de tu experiencia, para poder a ayudarnos a entender mejor. Ya pueden contestar esto. Vamos a tratar de hacerlo en menos de un minuto, pero creo que cada una de ustedes lo contestaron muy bien. Lo que he aprendido del bienestar y la resiliencia de mi comunidad es que somos gente luchadora, no nos damos por vencidos. Creo que esta pandemia fue muy dif\u00edcil, realmente ha sido una etapa muy dif\u00edcil para nuestra gente trabajadora que se han quedado sin trabajo, no hay escuela f\u00edsica, que eso de una u otra manera s\u00ed afecta, no poder tener la capacidad y la dignidad de ir a hacer nuestras propias compras, que eso tambi\u00e9n nos afecta el bienestar. Tantas cosas que han afectado esta pandemia. Pero fuera de eso, fuera de todo eso, nuestra comunidad sigue luchando, sigue hacia delante, sigue camellando todos los d\u00edas, la vemos activa. Por lo menos en Corona, en Jackson Heights, no se han dado por vencidos. Nosotros si tenemos que aru\u00f1ar la tierra, lo haremos, si tenemos que hacer lo tengamos que hacer. Somos muy recursivos. Somos muy innovadores. A veces no nos damos ese cr\u00e9dito. Somos muy echados para adelante, en el sentido de que podemos solucionar r\u00e1pido. Si tenemos que vender algo, lo hacemos. Si tenemos que crear algo, lo hacemos. Si tenemos que juntarnos y asociarnos con alguien para crear algo y ayudarnos mutuamente, lo hacemos. He aprendido eso acerca de nuestra comunidad. S\u00ed, el bienestar de nuestra comunidad ha sido afectado, es importante hablarlo y reconocerlo. Tenemos que hablar de la salud mental. Ha sido afectada nuestra comunidad lastimosamente, y tenemos que trabajar en pro de eso, de volver a levantarnos y estar ah\u00ed el uno por el otro, que lo hemos estado haciendo. A pesar de la necesidad que tenemos, porque cada uno ha sido afectado de una u otra manera, seguimos ayudando al vecino, seguimos ayud\u00e1ndonos mutuamente a pesar de que estamos en necesidad. Que es algo maravilloso y que muestra, como dec\u00eda Esmeralda, la solidaridad de nuestra comunidad. Entonces, eso comparto. \u00bfMarta?", "439": "S\u00ed. Yo, por ejemplo, escog\u00ed la palabra poder, porque a veces poder se dice es: \"Yo soy primero\", o se dice: \"Tengo mucho poder. Soy valiente\", y todo, pero me gusta much\u00edsimo una frase que dice: \"El poder se vuelve virtud cuando lo pones al servicio de los dem\u00e1s\". Entonces, eso es el poder, nuestra comunidad tiene-- a veces no sabemos, pero tenemos mucho poder cuando nos unimos. A veces uno quisiera llegar a todos, pero a veces no podemos; y s\u00ed, hay familias que tal vez tiraron la toalla, porque s\u00ed hay. \u00bfQu\u00e9 otra cosa? Soy muy sensible, pero como todas las compa\u00f1eras dicen, hemos aprendido-- para nosotros nunca ha sido nada f\u00e1cil, entonces un virus no nos va a tirar, al contrario. Sabemos que nuestra comunidad fue la m\u00e1s golpeada, pero aqu\u00ed estamos. No es f\u00e1cil porque he escuchado historias de que, tal vez la familia quiere salir adelante a hacer sus actividades y est\u00e1 la polic\u00eda, les pone ticket; entonces ha sido un poco dif\u00edcil, pero somos fuertes y estamos aqu\u00ed, saliendo adelante.", "440": "Eso s\u00ed. Gracias, Marta. \u00bfGladys?", "441": "Okay. Gracias, Marta, por ser fuerte y llorar, porque las personas que lloran demuestran fortaleza. Quiero responder a la pregunta. Yo he aprendido la resistencia. He aprendido a luchar y pelear en forma organizada, a ver que hay que seguir las reglas, porque si no seguimos las reglas no se puede trabajar en comunidad. He aprendido que, como mam\u00e1, tenemos que poner el hombro para que esto salga adelante y no tenemos que tenerle miedo a las cosas que vienen. He aprendido que Dios tiene el control de todo esto, y que nosotros no tenemos que irnos para atr\u00e1s, sino ir para adelante y dar la cara para todo lo que venga. Como, por ejemplo, este reto que fue el corona. Yo digo que fue el corona porque ya lo estamos ganando, y eso con toda la tecnolog\u00eda que no exist\u00eda en los tiempos pasados, ha venido ahora a salvar la vida de las personas, porque las medicinas antiguas son lo que realmente han salvado a la gente. Para m\u00ed, mucha gente que ha estado en la casa se ha curado y mucha gente que ha ido al hospital ha muerto. Entonces, hay que tener fe en los conocimientos que ten\u00edan nuestros padres, nuestros ancestros. Tambi\u00e9n he aprendido que el tiempo que nosotros podemos dar tiene mucho valor, porque hay mucha gente que te llama y te pide una ayuda en un tiempo que no es seg\u00fan el tiempo, pero uno ya no pone tiempo a eso cuando las cosas pasan, porque no interesa. Es un tiempo voluntario que t\u00fa tienes que darlo y que lo das con amor, porque as\u00ed podemos ayudar a mucha gente. He aprendido que se puede hacer un plato de comida m\u00e1s para darle a un vecino, para darle a un amigo, para darle al que realmente lo necesita, y que eso te llena el coraz\u00f3n y que est\u00e1s haciendo algo bueno, positivo, por la gente y por nuestra comunidad que lo necesita. Todo eso. He aprendido mucho a ser m\u00e1s solidaria con todos, a ser humilde, y que lo de afuera no interesa, sino lo que tiene uno adentro en el coraz\u00f3n. Gracias.", "442": "Gracias, Gladys. \u00bfTania?", "443": "Bueno, yo voy a tomar un poco de lo que las tres dijeron. S\u00ed, nuestra comunidad es muy luchadora, siempre est\u00e1 buscando la manera de salir adelante. Hay gente que se ha quedado sin trabajo, se queda en la casa y empieza a hacer pan y empiezan a invitar a los amigos, \"Estoy vendiendo pan\", y as\u00ed se ganan su d\u00eda a d\u00eda, aunque sea 20 d\u00f3lares al d\u00eda, eso es para darle de comer a sus hijos, porque hay veces en que no sabemos la situaci\u00f3n de nuestro vecino. Entonces, esta pandemia tambi\u00e9n nos ha ayudado a hacer eso, a estar m\u00e1s pendientes de nuestro alrededor, de las personas que tenemos al lado, a los que tal vez nunca les dijimos \"Hola\", ahora les estamos viendo si est\u00e1 bien, si necesita algo, si podemos ayudar en algo. Entonces, yo pienso que esta comunidad es muy unida, a pesar de que hay algunas temporadas que hay conflictos, pero yo pienso que en general somos unidos y siempre estamos viendo por el otro.", "444": "Definitivamente. Gracias, Tania. \u00bfMayra?", "445": "Perd\u00f3n. Yo creo que, sin duda, los tiempos que estamos pasando son muy complicados, pero si algo tengo que decir de mi comunidad y de las vivencias que yo he tenido, es que definitivamente somos unos guerreros. Como han dicho nuestras compa\u00f1eras anteriormente, estamos viendo personas que se est\u00e1n, como decimos en Per\u00fa, \"recurseando\" como sea: est\u00e1n haciendo comiditas, est\u00e1n haciendo las mascarillas. Ah\u00ed tengo el caso, conozco una persona que lo est\u00e1 haciendo de manera gratuita, para ayudar a la comunidad. Entonces, el valor que yo dije, el de la solidaridad, creo que es algo que a nosotros esta pandemia nos ha hecho aprender, definitivamente. Creo que todas las personas, todos los vecinos, todas las personas que podemos darnos una manito, siempre vamos a estar ah\u00ed para hacerlo porque eso es lo que nos identifica como latinos, como hispanos, siempre vamos a tener as\u00ed-- yo siempre he dicho que el que menos tiene es el que m\u00e1s da. Porque a veces hay personas que tienen mucho pero que son ego\u00edstas, el que menos tiene se preocupa m\u00e1s por ayudar a las personas, \"vamos a hacer esto\", y estamos mirando muchos casos dentro de nuestra comunidad. Hay personas que han tenido p\u00e9rdidas de familiares, y eso los ha impulsado para ser voluntarias y para poder ayudar a otras personas. La capitana del equipo de Brooklyn, en lo que nosotros estamos trabajando en el censo, ella perdi\u00f3 a su mam\u00e1, y ella, sin embargo, ella se recuper\u00f3 y dijo: \"No, yo tengo que ayudar a mi comunidad porque no solamente soy yo, sino somos todos los que estamos perdiendo familia, estamos perdiendo personas importantes en nuestra vida\". Se miran casos tan terribles y tan tristes, que hay personas que no pueden ni siquiera encontrar a sus muertos. Entonces, la solidaridad, me parece que esa es la palabra clave del aprendizaje que nosotros hemos tenido ahora en estos tiempos dif\u00edciles de pandemia. Muchas gracias.", "446": "Gracias, Mayra. Esmeralda.", "447": "Bueno, pues, yo creo que en esta pandemia he aprendido mucho. Al principio, cuando me un\u00ed a [risas] ECP a trabajar pens\u00e9 que \u00edbamos a planificar eventos. Nunca me imagin\u00e9 que lo primero que fu\u00e9ramos a planificar fuera un food pantry donde pudi\u00e9ramos ayudar. He aprendido mucho tanto de Mar\u00eda, como de J\u00e9ssica. Siempre he escuchado algo que dice que: \"Debemos de tratar a las personas con dignidad\", y eso es verdad. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque las personas vienen hacia nosotros y, aunque a lo mejor en ciertos momentos estaban bien econ\u00f3micamente, la pandemia nos vino a remover a todos nuestra econom\u00eda; a las personas que ten\u00edan un poco de ahorros, vinieron a acabar con sus ahorros, en estos momentos iban a pedir, a hacer una cita para que les di\u00e9ramos comida. Y creo que siempre es eso, \u00bfno? Aprend\u00ed a tratarlas con dignidad. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Porque nosotros nunca sabemos cu\u00e1ndo nos toque estar en esa l\u00ednea esperando por esa ayuda. Una vez una persona que yo quiero mucho, que no es familia exactamente, pero podr\u00eda ser mi t\u00edo, algo as\u00ed, \u00e9l siempre me dijo: \"El que no vive para servir, no sirve para vivir\", y esto creo que lo he reforzado durante todo este tiempo. Porque es verdad, si no estoy dispuesto a servir a los dem\u00e1s, pues realmente creo que en este tiempo de pandemia no hubiera tenido sentido trabajar en una organizaci\u00f3n sin estar dispuesta a dar lo mejor de uno, al tratar mejor a las personas, como dice Lucero. Es bien bonito escuchar: \"Gracias, porque no me hicieron esperar cinco, seis, siete horas, para que al final no me tocara un n\u00famero y me quedara sin alimentos\". He escuchado a mam\u00e1s decir: \"Gracias, porque hoy mis hijos pudieron comer\", y eso es, en lo personal, muy satisfactorio. No por el hecho de decir: \"Pudimos hacerlo\", no, sino por el hecho de tratarlos con dignidad, de que nunca los tratamos, ni fuimos ni nos sentimos superiores a ellos, llegaban y los trat\u00e1bamos con mucha dignidad. \u00bfPor qu\u00e9? Por lo mismo, nunca sabemos cu\u00e1ndo se van a cambiar los papeles y pueda ser al rev\u00e9s. S\u00ed, como dicen todas, estoy de acuerdo que vamos poco a poquito, no nos vamos a quedar como comunidad en el piso, vamos a volver a luchar, vamos a volver a salir. Y lo estamos viendo, muchas personas", "448": "comenzaron o regresaron a lo que hac\u00edan o lo que aprendieron en sus pa\u00edses. En lo personal, un chico se puso vender-- trabajaba en la construcci\u00f3n, por todo esto de que no hay trabajo ni nada, en M\u00e9xico aprendi\u00f3 a hacer helados, nieves, y \u00e9l los est\u00e1 llevando en deliveries, le preguntaba: \"\u00bfTienes carro?\", me dice: \"No, yo los llevo en una hielera con un carrito de lavander\u00eda y as\u00ed los reparto\". Eso somos, seres humanos que no nos damos por vencidos, que aunque nos ha tratado muy duro este virus, a todos; muchos perdieron familiares, muchos perdimos muchas cosas, pero nos vamos a levantar, no nos vamos a quedar ah\u00ed y vamos a salir de todo esto. Y creo que es un aprendizaje que a m\u00ed, en lo personal, me ha hecho mucho bien, estar ah\u00ed cada ocho d\u00edas, poder ayudar y simplemente recibir bendiciones. Gracias.", "449": "Gracias, Esme. \u00bfY Lucero?", "450": "Ay, \u00bfqu\u00e9 puedo decir? [risas] Ya todo lo han dicho, creo. Lo que dijo Esmeralda, de verdad que fue gratificante el poder estar ah\u00ed con todas las personas que acud\u00edan cada semana, como dice ella, recibir sus bendiciones, las gracias, el ver la cara de los ni\u00f1os cuando se les daba un chocolate, cuando se les daba un libro, cuando se les daba unas crayolas. o simplemente ver a las mam\u00e1s cuando recib\u00edan su paquete de pa\u00f1ales. Esa cara de felicidad, de agradecimiento, de que en ese momento ellas tal vez hubiesen querido darnos, qu\u00e9 se yo, un abrazo fuerte para agradecer. Tantas cosas, \u00bfme entiendes? Pero la verdad es que para m\u00ed fue gratificante trabajar all\u00e1 con ECP ayudando a las familias, la verdad fue hermoso.", "451": "Gracias, Lucero.", "452": "Gracias.", "453": "Gracias a todas ustedes por compartir. Siento que parte de la actividad que est\u00e1bamos haciendo, y de grabar para esto y para lo otro, no hemos tenido como un momento de poder realmente compartir estas cosas, siempre estamos en reuniones, y que planificar, y que esto, y que lo otro, y las llamadas y que ta ta ta. Pero es bien lindo poder escuchar los pensamientos de cada una de ustedes, y ver y escuchar sus historias, es muy gratificante. Bueno, por \u00faltimo, vamos a hacer dos cosas para ya terminar nuestra llamada. Alex va a pasar-- antes de cerrar la llamada, vamos a hacer un survey, una encuesta, que va a aparecer en el cuadro del chat, Alex lo est\u00e1 poniendo en el chat, para que ustedes lo contesten, tomen unos cinco minutos para contestarlo. Ahora, la encuesta s\u00ed es en ingl\u00e9s. Si usted se siente m\u00e1s c\u00f3modo en contestar la encuesta en espa\u00f1ol, usted me va a dejar saber personalmente en el WhatsApp de las embajadoras, y yo voy a hablar personalmente con Alex para ver si nos lo puede traducir a espa\u00f1ol, \u00bfbueno? Por ahora, si me hace el favor, Esmeralda, de copiar el link, y poner este link en el chat de las embajadoras, y lo hacemos cuando tengamos tiempito, definitivamente en esta semana. Creo que cinco minutos va a tomar de su tiempo, \u00bfbueno? Por \u00faltimo, Alex me dijo que no escuch\u00f3 grabar cuando cada uno dio el consentimiento, entonces es importante que lo volvamos a hacer para que quede grabado que cada una dio consentimiento acerca de que esto se va a grabar. Entonces, yo voy a leer otra vez ese p\u00e1rrafo, que es bien importante, y despu\u00e9s cada una va a dar el consentimiento diciendo \"S\u00ed, acepto\", y ya despu\u00e9s terminamos la reuni\u00f3n. Entonces, voy a leer este p\u00e1rrafo una vez m\u00e1s. Okay. \"Esta conversaci\u00f3n ser\u00e1 grabada, transcrita, y se agregar\u00e1 para hacer crecer una colecci\u00f3n de conversaciones similares. Vamos a proporcionar estas grabaciones a periodistas, funcionarios p\u00fablicos, acad\u00e9micos y a otros participantes y asociados con el proyecto, con la meta final de hacerles accesibles al p\u00fablico en general. Como participante en esta conversaci\u00f3n, usted est\u00e1 dando permiso para que Cortico y Local Voices Network, o Red de Voces Locales, usen la grabaci\u00f3n de acuerdo con su misi\u00f3n de promover conversaciones en las comunidades y los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n para mejorar nuestro entendimiento de los dem\u00e1s. Esta es una conversaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y parte de ella puede llegar a aparecer en un peri\u00f3dico local o ser transmitida en una estaci\u00f3n de radio local. As\u00ed que por favor no diga nada que no quisiera que oyera el p\u00fablico en general. Si usted comprende esto y est\u00e1 de acuerdo, digan: \"Estoy de acuerdo\". Entonces, vamos a pasar una por una por el orden de participaci\u00f3n, comenzando con Marta.", "454": "Estoy de acuerdo.", "455": "\u00bfGladys?", "456": "S\u00ed, consiento.", "457": "S\u00ed, estoy de acuerdo, si puedes decir.", "458": "S\u00ed, estoy de acuerdo.", "459": "Gracias. \u00bfTania?", "460": "Estoy de acuerdo.", "461": "Gracias. \u00bfMayra?", "462": "S\u00ed, estoy de acuerdo.", "463": "\u00bfEsmeralda?", "464": "S\u00ed, estoy de acuerdo.", "465": "\u00bfLucero? \u00bfLucero?", "466": "Estoy de acuerdo.", "467": "Gracias, Lucero. Bueno, gracias una vez m\u00e1s a cada una de ustedes. Feliz viernes. Feliz fin de semana. Much\u00edsimas gracias por ser parte de esto. Yo le dije a Alex que cualquier historia, cualquier grabaci\u00f3n que se utilice usando esta grabaci\u00f3n, que por favor nos la env\u00ede y se las voy a compartir a cada uno de ustedes para que cada una lo vean, en el caso que ella lo haga. Bueno, entonces, una vez m\u00e1s, muchas gracias. [foreign] voy ya a terminar la conversaci\u00f3n. [foreign].", "468": "[foreign].", "469": "Bye.", "470": "[diafon\u00eda]", "471": "Bye.", "472": "[inaudible] Okay, continue. I think I'm the only one that got that recording prompt. Okay. Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. We have begun recording at this time, and need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded, and the audio will become part of the LVN collection.", "473": "There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we lift up the voices and needs of the communities to candidates, local policy makers, and members of the media. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation.", "474": "Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations.", "475": "Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at, Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.

If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\"", "477": "I agree.", "478": "I agree.", "479": "I agree.", "480": "Wonderful. Okay. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and to learn from others in this conversation, and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines. They're also on the materials we sent with your confirmation email.", "481": "Number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share the time. Allow others to finish speaking, and take turns. Four, stay curious and ask honest questions. Five, pause and take time for reflection. Six, listen generously. Assume good intentions, while recognizing that your words have an impact. Seven, when possible, close unnecessary programs, applications and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone onboard with these guidelines?", "482": "Yes.", "483": "Yes.", "484": "Yes.", "485": "Is there anything you would like to add or change?", "486": "No.", "487": "I don't know what's about too much, so I can't add and I can't change.", "488": "Okay.", "489": "Let me hear the questions.", "490": "Okay. Here we go. For the ease of this virtual conversation, we are going to use a modified circle, where each person will take a turn. I'm going to mute and unmute each person as their turn comes around, which will help transition us from one person to the next. You can always pass on a question, or pass and ask for us to come back to you. Does anyone have any questions about this process.", "491": "Okay. If I want to speak, and so do I interrupt you? How do I handle that?", "492": "I'm going to mute and unmute so that everyone is able to talk one person at a time. You don't have to worry. When it's your turn, you'll be able to speak.", "493": "Okay.", "494": "Okay. To begin, we want to do a quick round of introductions. Please share just your first name or a pseudonym. Did someone else join?", "495": "My name's Sofia.", "496": "Okay. I think no one else joined. Okay. Thank you, Sofia. Share your name or just a pseudonym. If you don't want to use your real name. In addition to your first name, please share a little bit of background, who you are, where you live or what you do, and a value that is important to you and how it is related to what brought you here today. For the first round, I'll start.", "497": "My name is Elana. I'm a social worker at the Jewish Community Council of Greater Coney Island. One of my values is honesty and transparency. Okay. Next, we're going to have Sofia.", "498": "My name's Sofia. I live in Brooklyn. I'm retired because my age is big, 78 years old. That's about everything. I'm honest, and I try to do my best-", "499": "Thank you.", "500": "... if I can.", "501": "Thank you so much. Next is Yehuda.", "502": "My name is Yehuda. I live in Queens, in Whitestone, next to the water, sound. I'm involved very much in Holocaust survivors' issues, like Selfhelp, and Claims Conference, WJRO and so on. My real value is the truth, which is unfortunately far from our leader.", "503": "Okay, thank you. I'm just going to admit, our participant here is waiting. Hi. This is Elana.", "504": "Hi. Hi, Elana.", "505": "Hi, thank you for joining. We're just going around and doing introductions so it's perfect timing. Okay?", "506": "Yeah, well, I had a problem because I was missing the last two pages, but I Eli, and she clarified for me. Unfortunately, like I say, my service with the Cablevision was somehow or other disrupted for the second consecutive day, so I have no Zoom, I have no landline, I have no WiFi, which is so unfortunate, but that's another story. Okay.", "507": "Okay. Thank you so much for joining. We're going around-", "508": "You're welcome. I left you a lengthy message on your thing because I said, maybe you could even help me with Cablevision, but I know it's not possible because it's nothing to do with anyone, it's just their lousy service, for some reason, is interrupted in a major way.", "509": "Okay. I'm going to ask the next person to introduce themselves. Okay? Toby. I'm trying to unmute her, but it's not working. Yule, can you unmute Toby? Maybe she muted herself.", "510": "Yeah, I can't.", "511": "You can't do it either. Okay. Toby, if you want to introduce yourself and you can unmute yourself, that would be great. We'll give you a few seconds to try to unmute yourself and see if we can hear you.", "512": "I'm pressing the button, \"unmute.\"", "513": "Okay, good. We hear you now. Perfect.", "514": "What do you know? All right. Should I introduce myself again, start over?", "515": "Yes, please.", "516": "My name is Toby Levy. I live in the Brighton Beach area, by the ocean. I'm in the United States about 70 years. I'm a child survivor from Europe. I'm very active in the Museum, and I give a lot of testimony to schools. I'm retired, of course. My values, great values. I survived with my parents. My parents were Orthodox and stayed Orthodox all their lives, so am I. I have children, and they're also Orthodox. My values is to be honest, not to hate anybody. To love your neighbor as you love yourself. Teach the right path, what's right and what's wrong, and live a righteous life. That's my values, and I keep at them.", "517": "What else is there to say? I said I volunteer in the Museum very much, I'm very active, and I try to teach as much as I can not to hate. To me, this is very, very important because hatred brings the worst out in a person. When you begin to hate, in the end you can't stop. I've learned not to hate at all.", "518": "Okay. Thank you, Toby. Next we're going to have Frederica. If you could just introduce yourself. If you only want to use your first name, that's fine, and a little bit of background info, who you are, and a value that's important to you.", "519": "That's me?", "520": "Yes.", "521": "Okay. I didn't know. Okay, so my name is Frederica. I didn't exactly know what would be the nature of this particular meeting, but of course, I would love to be of assistance to anyone that would benefit from my assistance. I wasn't prepared to really reflect on my values, so let me just introduce my background a bit.", "522": "I came from Poland in 1964, and I came directly from Warsaw, at the time when there was already some degree of pressure on the Jewish people to leave the communist country on account of some political changes that were taking place. I received my education in Poland. I graduated from medical school in Warsaw, and I left within less than a year after my graduation. I was able to pass all the necessary tests, and so on in the United States, and I became fully licensed as a physician. I was a practicing psychiatrist for a number of years. I'm still licensed, however, I no longer practice.", "523": "As for my values, I believe ... Oh, obviously, I'm Jewish, and I suffered unbelievable horrors as a young child. I'm a survivor of Warsaw ghetto, a child survivor of Warsaw ghetto. I guess, in a way, I'm like an endangered species by now because there are very, very few people with my background. I never really dealt with it, other than in personal analysis, as a requirement for my profession, and so on. As I said, at this point in my life, obviously, I am Jewish. I am not Orthodox, I never was. I didn't come from an Orthodox background, but I do believe in high moral values and I do belong to a conservative synagogue.", "524": "Perhaps, I'm in the center, so to speak, of my congregation. I would like to think so, although I guess, like number of people, I may be viewed as a leader of my conservative, and as a conservative by the liberals so, again, it's kind of an odd position. I do believe in high moral values and I think moral values should guide anyone in what they are doing, including seeking one's background and paying tribute to the past generations. That is very much on my mind.", "525": "I guess, that's all I can say right now. I do have two children, and I never burdened them with my background, as I felt that perhaps this is not their responsibility and it's not their fault what I went through as a very young child. That's where I'm at right now. Thank you for inviting me to join. I would like to, perhaps, answer or participate in any farther discussion.", "526": "Okay. Thank you so much, everyone, for introducing yourselves and providing that background information. We're going to continue with the circle discussion starting with Sofia, then Yehuda, then Toby, and then Frederica. Everyone is going to have a chance to speak for the next question. Again, if you want to pass on a question or you want us to come back to you, just let me know. Okay.", "527": "The next thing we would like to do is invite you to share a little bit about yourself. Since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing look like and feel like to you.", "528": "Next, think of a time, place or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? How did you feel? We will go around one at a time to share our stories. Please remember that this is being recorded, so we ask that you not disclose any sensitive personal health information, or use the names of other people when telling your stories. I'll start.", "529": "I feel healthiest in my life when I am taking part in self-care. When I take care of myself, when I practices intuitive eating, when I focus on the moment and incorporate meditation into my day. In fact, I just downloaded an application and I started using it to help me with being mindful with meditation, with helping me stay calm and centered. I see wonderful effects already. It's very, very helpful for me to take a deep breath from time-to-time, just to help center myself, and it helps me feel good emotionally.", "530": "Okay. I'm just going to give everyone a minute to think about what they would like to share about a time when they felt their best in terms of health and wellness. If everyone would like to take a deep breath at this time to center and help think of a story that they want to share, that's perfect too. Just in and out. Okay. We're going to start with Sofia.", "531": "You know my name. I live in my apartment. I like it where I live. I enjoy ... I'm not so well, healthy. Not so healthy. Now in situation, what's happened now it's a little bit stressy, whatever. I don't know what to say about me. First of all, my language is very poor. That's why I don't know what to say. I take a medication by myself. This one I can do. I have a lady who help me very much, and I am very happy that Erin, help me with this one. She help me, she call me, she's made my day better. What can I tell you more about?", "532": "I dress by myself, I eat by myself. I read, I watch television, I read a book. Because when you stay at home for three months, it's very lonely, you have to do something. That's why I read a book and I watch television about news, everything. I hope everything is going to be all right in my country, in America I mean.", "533": "Thank you so much, Sofia. Okay. Next is Yehuda.", "534": "My name is Yehuda. I live in Queens, next to the ocean. I have a beautiful ocean view. As I said, I'm involved very much in Holocaust survivors' issues. I'm a member of Selfhelp, an organization that's helping needy survivors financially and home care. I am a member of WJRO, an organization that strives to recover assets of Holocaust survivors in Israel and Europe. I am a member of the Board of Directors of Claims Conference. We have a meeting, a Zoom meeting at the end of the month.", "535": "I came from Israel. I lived there 30 years. I finished my studies, my first degree at Jerusalem University. Then I took my MBA in the United States, in New York. I worked mostly in IT, Information Technology. I was Director of Ministry of Defense in Israel, of their IT organization. Then I finished here also as Director of Information Technology, and I'm retired. Thank you for ... By the way, I have also a problem. Autoimmune disease, Myasthenia Gravis, and I am on steroids, prednisone.", "536": "Okay, thank you. Next, I'm going to repeat the prompt and then we're going to continue with Toby. The question is to think of a time, place or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? How did you feel when you were at your best? Toby, go ahead. Oh, I can't unmute her again. Toby, can you unmute yourself?", "537": "Can you hear me now?", "538": "Yes.", "539": "All right, thank you. Okay, Elana. I know exactly what happened to my ... As I'm sure you know by now, survivors did not have an easy life until you come to yourself. Anyway, we didn't know how to talk, and we didn't know how to express, so everything I kept in me. I was young. When I was young, I had children. Then I had too much stress with the kids, with life, with teaching, with being afraid. When I was raising my kids, was the hardest part of fear. Fear, what's going to happen to them, what happened to me, always compare.", "540": "The point I'm trying to say is I was so tightly. Then one time, I said to myself, \"I'm going to explode. I must talk. I must learn how to come in and talk.\" I exploded, and I had to have surgery. I had my hysterectomy when I was 33 years old. After that, I said to myself, \"Mm-hmm (negative). Things have to change. I have to live.\" First I joined the gym, and I learned to talk, to express what I feel. Then I did exactly ... I've been doing this for years, Elana. Laying down on the couch and thinking of my issues. \"What's bothering me? How can I solve them?\"", "541": "This is so I learn to solve my issues by thinking. Laying down on that couch, without a therapist, on my own. Mostly, the gym helped me. I went every morning, 6:00. Don't forget, I worked, raised a family. I had parents. My parents were sick. My sister died young, my parents died. All this, I had to be involved. The day, I went to the gym, went swimming, I came home. I was able to manage the day very well. Slowly, I learned to talk to myself, how to solve my issues. I learned not to answer right away, to think about it, to contemplate what's in my mind.", "542": "This was how I learned to survive. It worked for me until today. Until today, I don't answer if I know it's going to be the wrong answer. I learned to control my tongue. I lay down on that couch, I think about it, solve how to go about it. At the gym, I don't go to gym anymore because I have a problem with my back, so but I walk every morning for an hour, at least, an hour, hour and a half. In the afternoon, until this virus came out, I still went to see my son. Married late, so he has two little girls now. Once a week, I would go to play with the girls.", "543": "I still am very active. Of course, the Museum is what gives me life, and health, and thinking positive. I've learned to think positive. Even with this coronavirus. Everybody was hysterical. I said, \"Hey, that shall pass too.\" Right now, we have to sit home. What's so wrong sitting home? I have my home, I have my food. What's wrong with it? I can sit on my porch, I can go on the boardwalk.", "544": "You can make it, if you think positive. This is how I taught my kids. This is how I learned to survive, and that's how it's keeping me healthy. Of course, I watch what I eat. I only eat three meals a day. I eat my, whatever. No noshing in-between, it would be only a fruit. I keep my weight. I watch my cholesterol, I watch my pressure. I have AFib, so I watch my heartbeat. I watch these things. I stay off of medication as much as possible, but I do it on my own, controlling it. I keep myself healthy mentally and bodily. That's what helps me. I hope I gave you enough.", "545": "Yes. Thank you so much.", "546": "I stuck to the subject.", "547": "Thank you, okay. Next, we're going to go to Frederica.", "548": "Thank you. Well, I cannot say that I have any prescription. I cannot say that I feel that healthy. I'm very pragmatic. I find that, for my part, there is an element of luck. I admit I'm fatalistic, therefore, I try to accept things as they happen even if I don't have control over them. Because I find that helps me, since the situation may be so bleak that, on my part, I find accepting things for what they are works better for me than to fight it because I do not have the control. If I try to control it, it would cause me more frustration than benefit. This is just general guideline.", "549": "As for myself, I am very busy day-to-day. I'm not practicing medicine anymore, but I have to say that the coronavirus situation changed my life quite dramatically in a way that I had to give up in person participation, a number of activities that I miss sorely. While I fought bitterly the feeling of loss and almost despondency, learning to accept it and finding some collateral way to deal with it, that's helped me. Whenever I go on that course I'm, again, in big trouble. I hope that at one time, there will be a way of returning to in person participation in numerous activities.", "550": "I'll only name one that took many hours of my week. Competitive bridge playing in person. I didn't develop enough to be playing online. I never developed the skills while I could. Now, under pressure, I find it mechanical and I'm not good at it. Something I was good at, suddenly I am not good at because it's the way that it's being played. It's obviously still too risky to play in person. The clubs are closed.", "551": "As I say, this loss, meeting in person. The book club. Transition to Zoom was the most peaceful in terms of the book club. Transition to some other meetings like yoga class on Zoom is fine. Just so happens, the second day of the loss of my whole online connection, except for the cellphone, which unfortunately, Cablevision put me in that situation. I hope they will fix it soon. You see, this situation with so many losses.", "552": "I'm not even about all the unfortunate people that died during this pandemic. I'm just thinking for myself and so many of these losses that occurred. Even the stupid loss of Cablevision service. Because whatever it is that they didn't watch well enough to maintain the system, and caused that kind of disruption that could not have been prevented. This is a loss to me too.", "553": "With each subsequent loss of different magnitude, I feel so much is being lost that I find harder and harder to adjust to all these losses along the way. For my part, I would say I hope we will continue or enter some sort of meaningful recovery. It very much impacted on my wellbeing, there's no question about it, and continues to. Thank you.", "554": "Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your wonderful answers. We want to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly and share about, whether your neighborhood community, or your social community, or any other community that you are involved in.", "555": "When you are responding to questions, if you are speaking about questions related to a particular community, please share what community you are thinking of when you share your story. I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope this will be a time for some back and forth among you as you share your stories. I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so.", "556": "What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. All right. I'm going to unmute everyone so that we can have a conversation. Okay. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? Anyone can-", "557": "You have to mention name, probably.", "558": "Okay. Sofia, you can start.", "559": "Okay, all right. Community, what I have now, community. I am very happy. They help me very, very much. First of all, I don't want to talk about my diseases, because it's too much in public, but they help me. Erin. I always said it Erin. She call me, she always take care of me. I am very happy when she call me. She's a very nice person. She helped me a lot. With the help, with everything she helped me. I like her very much. Besides this one, I like people. If I can help, I will help and try to be ... I like when people is honest. That's very much mean a lot. When they lie, that's no good. That's it. What else I can tell you?", "560": "Can you tell us which community Erin is a part of?", "561": "It's our community. It's a Jewish community. Just a minute. JCC, JCI, I think.", "562": "Okay, perfect. Anything else you wanted to add?", "563": "It's a perfect community. They give me transport when I have to go to doctor, because I go to the doctor often. I don't like to think about this one, but it's happened. I was sick very much. I have pneumonia, but not the virus. I was in the hospital five days and she helped me very much, this moment, when I can do nothing. It's very good to have a nice help, and our company, one of the best I call this one, which I tell you, before.", "564": "Okay, thank you. Does anyone have anything to add about what in their community is working well to support their health and wellbeing.", "565": "Okay. I want to say something. I live in a wonderful little ... Let's say part of the overall community. To my total surprise, and of course, where I live one of the neighborhoods with whom I had some contact with, I can say, \"Hi, [Ella 00:35:18].\" She's a member of modern Orthodox, very sophisticated person. Yet, she reached out to me even though I'm not representing that community, of being part of. She obviously accepted me fully and continues to be, I call her my guardian angel.", "566": "She's amazing. She has a busy family, and she has a lot of responsibilities. Yet, she reached out to me and continues to do so. It is beyond my expectation that someone like this could help me, but several other neighbors, knowing that I'm older than them immediately offered to do the shopping for me. Which I'm, being fiercefully independent, so I hesitated for a long time. Then, of course, I asked one of them to help me.", "567": "Again, the help came at a time when I knew I didn't want to recognize I needed it, but I needed it. They went beyond of what I was trying to communicate. They basically said, \"No. Get hold of yourself. It's too dangerous for you.\" I cannot tell you how much I appreciate the modern Orthodox community around me, in my immediate vicinity, of their outreach and willing to accept me even though I drive on Saturday, and most of them know it.", "568": "Instead of putting a distance between themselves, on the contrary. They continue to express interest in me. I have to say I give the biggest credit to the people who can be so open-minded despite some people's opinion who think they do not identify with the rest of the Jewish community. In my opinion they do, and I would never change my mind about it. I salute them for that ability. I'm just quite impressed. I only wish I could be helpful to others the way the people are helpful to me. [crosstalk]", "569": "Thank you, Frederica.", "570": "You're welcome.", "571": "Is there anyone else who wants to contribute something about what in their community is working well?", "572": "Community, working great.", "573": "Okay, good.", "574": "Are you going to let me in or should-", "575": "My name is Yehuda. I want to say a few words because I have another Zoom meeting with my granddaughter. I have to say, Holocaust survivors are telling me, \"If we survived the Holocaust, we'll survive this one too.\" Unfortunately, in our organization, poor people passed away from the virus. Of course, it's depressing that we cannot get out. For almost three months we are stuck at home to get delivery, food delivery through Instacart.", "576": "All-in-all, I'd say that we have, for us, it's much easier because we have now food on the table. We have phones. We have computer. We have television. During the Holocaust, we didn't have any of them. Many people perished. Six million Jews passed away or were murdered during the Holocaust.", "577": "I was on the Zoom meeting with Mr. Eizenstat from the State Department. He said that before the Holocaust we had 16 million Jews, and now even 75 years after that, we cannot reach that same number. We have like 13 million Jews all over the world. It's a tragedy. The most tragic event in history. We have to thank God that what we have now, we survived and we have a family, and to have children, and we have everything. This is a period of hardship but we overcome and we'll pass that.", "578": "[crosstalk] Excuse me, can I add something?", "579": "Oh god.", "580": "Yes.", "581": "Okay. What I omitted and I didn't think the question necessarily related to people that perhaps may be doing the outreach because they work in that area. I just feel that it would not be fair for me not to mention someone who was unbelievably helpful to me at a time of need. That is [Elisheva Lock 00:41:11]. Again, I have to mention her name. Some of you may know her. She is someone very special. She went beyond her call of duty in reaching out to me, so I continue to be very grateful to her. She is a very, very special individual who does require a lot of credit for the kind of work she does. That's what I wanted to add.", "582": "I agree with you 100%. She is special.", "583": "You see, we help each other by even sharing such thoughts.", "584": "Right.", "585": "Thank you very much for your remarks about how one needs to maintain positive attitude, because as much as we are losing, let's say, all of us in a different way now, certainly, our brothers and sisters lost so much more at that critical time, which you referred to of the Holocaust. Definitely, we are better off than them in a certain way.", "586": "Can I say something or should I keep quiet?", "587": "You can go, Miss Toby.", "588": "Are you sure? Okay. We talked about community. You're right. Community is very important. It's one of the reasons I live here. Jewish communities usually stick to each other. I have great community because it's a great Jewish area. My synagogue is my community. That's where I go. That's where I get my feedback. Of course, Selfhelp is there for the survivors. Besides the survivors, Jewish communities usually help each other. I have calls from all over. The Museum, every week, somebody calls me up to make sure how I'm doing.", "589": "The Jewish community, there's Selfhelp, there's JCC. If you need them, we have them. It's wherever you live. I think they're even in Jersey, because I have some kids, family live there. They're just as great. I feel that the Jews, they're taught from day number one in their schools how to help each other. First of all, that your parents are number one, and then goes your neighbors, and then goes everybody else. We should not want, with the neighbors. It's you're taught how to behave. I'm not surprised as Frederica tells me this Jewish Orthodox girl is helping her, because this is what she was taught, to help.", "590": "I am very comfortable where I live because it's a great area. I have JCC, which is there. I have Selfhelp, which thank god, I don't need their help. I'm grateful to God that gave me the strength to do all my own, that I help others. I have friends that I call every single day to make sure, how are they doing? This is the teaching, and of course, the community you live in. I found it here. That's why I'm staying and I'm not moving anyplace. I think I gave you enough.", "591": "Okay. Thank you everyone for sharing your voices in that conversation. Now we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question we invite you to share, what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you would like other people to hear? We'll start with Sofia.", "592": "I don't know what to say. I liked everything, what you ask us, first of all. I very appreciate your company, our Jewish company that they help us, they think about us. It's mean a lot when you get older, it's true. I wish everybody to be healthy and enjoy life, whatever we have left, I have left. There is people ... Sorry. Maybe I'm not talking so nice, but whatever I can tell, I tell you.", "593": "Yes, you're-", "594": "I don't know. People talk about history. I don't know that you have to talk about all history, where you born, how you born, where you work. I don't tell this one because I think we know very good everything, who's working, who's not working. I always was working in America. I never stopped, one day off, and never have food stamps, nothing. I think I'm a good citizen. That's it. I'm sure it's not nice to talk about yourself good, but I'm sorry. Thank you very much that you call us. I very enjoy your conversation. Your conversation, everything.", "595": "Thank you. Thank you so much, Sofia. That was great. We're going to move on to Yehuda to invite you to share, what is one thing that you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation?", "596": "I think also we have to thank you for initiating this conversation, the Zoom meeting. To hope that soon, we'll be able to meet in person.", "597": "I hope so. Thank you so much. Okay. Toby.", "598": "Okay. Can you hear me now?", "599": "Yeah.", "600": "Okay. I get from this conversation that all have the same feeling, the community is good to them, and the Jewish agencies are there to help the survivors. We can't, let's not just talk about survivors. I have in this community friends that are not survivors. They're getting the same type of help. We have the [Jasa's 00:48:00], where we go buy lunch there. We have lunch. Jasa couldn't open up because of the coronavirus, so we had delivered food to the house. It's not just the survivors, it's the community that's there. Which, of course, again, it's Selfhelp, JCC, and many others of those.", "601": "What I learned from each one of you, we all need the same, love and care. We need to be heard of. We need a call. We need a young person to come and knock, and this is what they neighborhoods usually do. They knock on the door, \"Are you okay? Do you need anything?\" That's what communities are. I think we all need the same, not just the survivors, and we're getting it.", "602": "Thank god, I have no complaints because thank god, I am able to help others, and this is what I do. I knew others, that they were sick, so I make sure I go visit. We sit six feet apart, but I make sure I visit. This is what it is to help another. Thank you for having me. Can I leave you now, it's 12:00? Or you need more, do you need more questions?", "603": "We're just going to hear from Frederica, and then wrap-up, so to be another 10 minutes. Okay?", "604": "I'll wait. Otherwise, I have to leave.", "605": "Thank you. Okay, so Frederica.", "606": "Really, thank you very much. It was interesting to hear the participants. Yehuda, I found your comments very upbeat. I was looking for a big comment that somehow or other I could perhaps utilize and I think I'll be carrying certain things you said. They might come back to my mind, because I do read and I try to bring myself to more ... I mean, to maintain some positive attitude.", "607": "When you said that in a spontaneous fashion, and you were not reading a text, this was not something ... You reflected on your feelings. I found it to be somehow, in a way, refreshing and meaningful. Of course, everybody else's comments were very helpful too. I wish everyone well. Thank you very much to you, Elana, because you are the one that reached out. I think you did a fabulous job. I hope you will feel very gratified in being able to coordinate this meeting.", "608": "I wish I would have been on Zoom, but again, I regret to say that the technical issues were way above me and out of my control. Which as I say, I wish it would not have happened, but I find that at least I adjusted to it, which perhaps will provide me with extra strength to say whatever happens, one has to deal with it one way or another, but hopefully in a positive way. Thank you all. I wish you all well.", "609": "Okay, thank you. Those are all of the questions that we have for you. Do you have any closing thoughts that you'd like to share? Any other general reflections on the conversation? Do you have any questions for us?", "610": "It was nice meeting you all, so to speak.", "611": "Hope that we meet in person soon.", "612": "My question would be to you, what does this help you? Where does it go from here?", "613": "I'm going to tell you right now. Just a reminder of what will happen with the thoughts that you just shared. These recordings will be transcribed, indexed, and eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in the Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Health Department.", "614": "We encourage you to spread the word about the Local Voices Network. If you want to convene another group of friends to participate or know of others who want to participate, please go to LVN.org. Thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts.", "615": "Thank you for having us.", "616": "Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I've began recording it, this time I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. Firstly, we want to create a space for our community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Secondly, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And thirdly, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we'll uplift the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policymakers and members of the media. For this and we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning this conversation with our positions on issues.", "617": "In this conversation, you're invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and well being of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to researchers, also to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cortico, the operative Local Voices Network, to use the recordings in accordance with this mission of fostering conversations in our communities, and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversations and portions that may appear on a local newspaper. In a local newspaper or on a website, we broadcast on a local radio station or appear elsewhere including other forms of media. So please only share what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say I agree. So I'll just go in the order of people on my screen. So Ramona.", "618": "Hi.", "619": "Do you agree?", "620": "I agree. Sorry, I feel like [inaudible 00:02:04].", "621": "No problem. It's allergy season. Jasmine.", "622": "I agree.", "623": "Thank you. Lynne.", "624": "I agree.", "625": "Kelly.", "626": "I agree.", "627": "Thank you all. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. One is to speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves. Share at a time and allow others to finish speaking, so take turns. Stay curious and ask honest questions. Pause if you need to and take time for reflection. Listen generously and assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. When possible, close up the unnecessary programs, applications, notifications and put your phone on silent. Is everyone on board with these guidelines, or is there anything you would like to add or change?", "628": "All right, so we're good to go. And so for the ease of this virtual conversation, we're going to use a modified circle process where each person will take a turn, because we're not in the real world where we're sitting around a table and we can easily see who's to the left of someone, who's to the right. Let's just use this circle method to keep that circle and that transition from one person to the next. And you can always pass or ask us to come back to you if you would like. So I will post the word in the chat and it just the order that we just used in the order that I'm just seeing people on my screen. So it'll be Ramona, Jasmine, Lynne and Kelly. Post that in the chat now.", "629": "And again, if you need more time to think or you want to pass, please feel free to do so. Anybody have any questions about that process? All right, awesome. So let's get started. So we want to do a quick round of introductions. So please share your first name or a pseudonym. And in addition to your first name, please share a little bit of background info about who you are, where you live, or what you do, and a value that's important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today. And so I'll start. My name is Yule, I work with Local Voices Network as a community builder in New York. I am born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, still here, never found a way out. And what I do is literally this, what we're doing today. A value that's important to me is family. I'm going to use that as my value just because of the times that we're in. And never taken my family for granted, but in this time, realizing how much more important it is to reconnect with family, how important it is to talk to your family. And I've talked to my mom pretty much every day since the pandemic started. And it's [inaudible] to reconnect not that you ever neglect your parents, but it's interesting to have those relationships. So family is my value. And I'll pass it to you, Ramona.", "630": "Hi, everyone. So my name is Ramona, I am based in the South Bronx, and I am an entrepreneur, social entrepreneur. I design baby clothing inspired by Hispanic heritage, and our sales actually support the work that I do in the community focused on public transportation, public housing and promote justice reform. A value that is important to me is ... still going to say access because I think that's at the root of a lot of the things that I address.", "631": "I'm next, right? Okay. So it's a long list of response. So I'm Jasmine, I'm looking at the [inaudible 00:06:35]. My background about who I am. So I live and work on Staten Island. I'm not from here, though. So it's been interesting, I've been here for about four years now. I'm from New Jersey, so it's similar but from a transitional perspective, especially with the things that are happening right now around racial unrest. That now entails a lot more dangerous to me than I felt when I lived in New Jersey. So it's been like ... even in my neighborhood, loss of Republican lawn signs, which doesn't ... whatever a person thinks that the person who they're supporting is a person who doesn't support me as a human being. So with especially in this moment right now, it's been really interesting walking my dog and things like that by myself. So that's just what's on my heart and mind right now. And also, it's interesting too, because my husband is white. So when I walk with him, I feel pretty safe. But when I'm alone, like with my little pitbull, I feel like there's a lot of ... a different impression of what's happening.", "632": "So just throwing that out there. So thinking about my value, is justice, especially right now. And again, I've said this before, usually my value is compassion. And I feel like leading with love is really important, and especially in conversations like this, being able to meet people as humans. But in this moment, and I guess in every moment, but we forget we're beyond that, and it's not about humanity more. I think it's about justice and having folks understand that. So that's my value and I came here to talk about my health and your health. I'm done.", "633": "So, hello everyone, how are you? My name is Lynne. I am actually an emergency medicine physician. I'm a professor of emergency medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. My passion, my calling is being the head of a non-profit called Mentoring in Medicine, where we look to inspire, educate and empower students, low income, first generation, who may have an interest in health careers, but definitely promoting healthy living. I actually live in New Rochelle. I was born and raised in Philadelphia, and most of my time is spent in the Bronx around the Norwood section at Montefiore, the Moses campus. Let's see, what value is important? There's so many especially now but I will say that health is very important. Mainly because it's really at the root of a lot of what's going on in today's society, our pandemic inside of a pandemic. And so yeah, I mean health and the maintenance of health not only personal health and wellness for leaders like ourselves, but also for our children and everyone. So health is really important.", "634": "Hello everyone. I have a toddler in the background. So if you hear him, I apologize. I oversee programs in North Brooklyn, from Williamsburg to East New York. And I live in the Bronx. And I live off of Fordham road. So last night was horrible for me. It sounded like a war zone. So today, I'm not my best. My word is respect. And that means multiple things during this time. But it resonates a lot with me because what we're going through but then also respecting boundaries, personal space, respecting people's property, respecting people's values, respecting people's thoughts, and just letting people be and feel is important to me right now.", "635": "Thank you, and thank you all for sharing. Next thing we're going to do is I'd like you to share a little bit about yourself. And since we're talking about health and well being today, I invite you to take a minute to think about what health and well being look and feel like to you. All right, so next is think of a time, place or a story where you felt you're at your best in terms of your health and wellness. Some questions to think about are, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What are some factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel? So we'll go around one at a time to share our stories. And so please remember that this is being recorded. So we ask that you not disclose any sensitive health information that you're not comfortable with sharing, or use the names of other people in telling your stories. And I'll start.", "636": "I felt healthiest in my life when I just had started college. And I think that was a time in my life when I really started understanding and taking control of my health. Personally, I was born with sickle cell and so having my parents just be there for me all the time, and make sure I was doing the right things and ... I had that coming up. But I never really understood what I needed to understand about my own personal health. So I feel like coming up in early college is when I really started taking control back for myself. So some of the things that were in place for me at that time were just ... I still had the support of my parents. So it was easier to afford whatever I needed to afford for my health. And again, I felt very in control of that. So in terms of my health and well being that's, for me, when I felt not only the healthiest, but also most in control of what I was doing. So that's me and I pass it to you, Ramona, if you're ready.", "637": "Sorry, I was responding to Jasmine's comment in the chat. I'm like I'm number two and I forget the ... I'm trying not to read the doc, but I keep having to go back to it because I started listening to people [crosstalk 00:12:58]. So I'm wondering if that's a good idea for when we're having our talks.", "638": "I can answer that. That's definitely ... it can be a good idea. If you feel comfortable with copy and pasting and putting things in the chat as well. I don't know if actual copy and paste works in the chat. Well, yeah it does. But I don't know if there's [inaudible] or anything but you can definitely go test it out and that's something that you can definitely do if you feel comfortable with doing. So I know we have a bit of an advantage because we have the script on hand and we have a chance to look at it, but most participants won't. So if you feel comfortable with doing that, yes, you can.", "639": "Okay. So thinking of a time that I felt healthy, probably would my second year in grad school. So about ... I can't remember, God. It wasn't that far ago. But I lived in Hawaii for about 10 years and by the second year there, I understood the community. I had found the neighborhood that I felt comfortable in, I had joined the gym, I was able to really work on my quality of life and having access to things that I never had growing up in the heights in here in the South Bronx. So I would schedule myself a gym class every day and I would go to the beach at least once a week and I would eat local produce and I would .... I started getting involved in some of the firm actions that were taking place there against genetically modified food and getting involved in indigenous struggles and I just felt more like myself, I felt lighter physically, I felt I was tense. I miss being tense.", "640": "I had a great place to live. I mean, my rent was 275 a month. And I'd go off to school. Yeah. I'm having a lot of moments right now. Even the gym membership for a year was like $75 for students. So I mean, the way that they prioritize and price things there, it makes such a difference in how you feel every single day and how you engage the world. And it changes the way you eat, it changes the way you live, it changes everything. So I think by the second year ... my first year was tough because I was scared and alone, but by the second year, I had figured it out. And I remember one of my professors saying, \"You look really good.\" And I was like, \"I do, and I feel really good.\" So I think that's the best I've felt. Even with my autoimmune illness, my pain was manageable. My treatments were helping, things were just working. So it was a good year.", "641": "Thank you Ramona. Jasmine.", "642": "So I think the best that I felt and this feels counterintuitive, but was after having my first child but it was maybe eight months postpartum between eight and 12 months is when my baby started to want to hang out with my husband. Sometimes I was able to put her down, like after I'm into attachment parenting all those things [inaudible] I helped this kid non stop for almost the first year for her life. So when she started to become more independent and turn into the toddler phase, she would go to other people and things like that and for some reason, getting pregnant and having a baby helped alleviate a lot of the long term ... I've always had migraines, I've always had really horrible nausea all day every day since I was 12 years old, and it just went away after I had a baby.", "643": "So once my body ... after birth, healed from birth, which took eight months after that. I feel like I felt the best that I have felt in years since I was younger than a teenager. And it was great because I got to ... I'm a personal trainer too. So it's like getting back into my exercise routine and being able to take some time for myself after my baby was secure and attachment and old enough to do other things. That was really important. And it just ... and I felt my health start to return to pre-baby a couple of months ago, and it's just interesting. I forgot that I felt like that all the time. Always having migraines, always feeling tired. So it was really interesting. But now I'm pregnant again. So maybe postpartum [inaudible 00:18:39]. Yeah, fingers crossed with a two year old and a newborn in a pandemic in my house. But we'll see. So that's mine.", "644": "Firstly, congrats again. And yeah, fingers crossed [inaudible 00:18:59]. Thank you for sharing. Lynne.", "645": "Yeah, thanks. Thanks everyone for sharing. So I will say that the best I ever felt I would say would be probably about two years after I had my daughter. And I will say because after I had her, I had a condition called postpartum cardiomyopathy, and I was essentially ... nearly died and had to take care of myself extra to get back to where I was functioning before. So during that time, I would say mentally, physically, spiritually, I felt like I was really in tune with myself, and I was able to practice meditation, some yoga, definitely exercise and also really was very connected to not only my physical family but my church family, even my neighborhood and it felt really great to be supported by others but also to be mentally ... especially after having been knocked to my knees, being mentally strengthened through non traditional methods that previous to that, I really had not taking stock in. And so it really emphasized to me a couple things, first of all that your mental health is very important, that between adverse childhood experiences and current experiences, people are really suffering and in pain. And they've been able to put that to the background but also that reflects how they act and how they think and how they feel. So I really took stock in that mental wellness and making that part of a whole.", "646": "The other thing is, after I found out that I had the postpartum cardiomyopathy and my heart was very weak, I really didn't have the stamina to do anything really, and really wasn't able to ... I wasn't able to even breathe really so just really learning how to breathe again, to walk distances, to undergo that cardio rehab was really important as far as building up and creating exercise routines and sticking with exercise routine, also diet. I became a vegetarian and I've since become a pescetarian. But I really just wanted to make sure during that time and moving forward, that I was able to as Ramona said, really have the fresh fruits and vegetables and incorporate that into my diet, vitamins for example, supplements. So all that became very important. So yeah, I mean, I think that was the best time. I know that was the best time.", "647": "Thank you. Thanks for sharing.", "648": "Sorry y'all, I'm feeding my toddler. So I've been listening but I've been multitasking because I'm myself with him here at home.", "649": "No problem.", "650": "When I felt the healthiest was actually pre-baby and congrats Jasmine. I was my ideal way, I was active. I was at a school in East New York that had no elevator, six floors going up and down the stairs multiple times a day, that was my workout. And it contributed to me having a healthy pregnancy where I was doing everything as if I was not pregnant, keeping in mind the constraints and making sure that I was staying safe but my pregnancy was so smooth. And I think it was because of that because I was at my optimal health, I was eating very healthy. I was meal prepping, I was getting my workouts in, and even mentally, I felt good. And I was very close to God at that time. So I felt that all around I was doing very well and it also allowed me to build mentoring relationships with people during that time. So I find that when I think about my health, I think about my emotional health and my relations with people tied to that and then my mental health as well as my physical health.", "651": "Thank you. Thank you all for sharing. We're going to move on to conversations now about your hopes and concerns for health and well being in your community. And for the purpose of this [crosstalk 00:24:01]. Yes you can.", "652": "I'm sorry I know that you're recording. When you use Zoom, people use the chat a lot, but they can't ... they're not recorded if they're in the chat. So are we encouraging people to just completely not use the chat or if they are using the chat at all to say what they're saying out loud, because I know we've done conversations before. And this part we don't want people to comment in between. But I imagine that because people can chat, they might say things in the chat. So how have you been handling that?", "653": "That's a very good question. The chat we usually use for logistics things. And I made that clear in the beginning. And yeah we would like everyone to respond verbally. And again, that's why there's the raise hand feature or you can ... actually for this part of the conversation, you'll even see that it's [inaudible] in the script. This first part was a little bit more linear where we went around one at a time to try to tell our stories. The chat loosens up after that. And there's going to be prompts and different things that if you have something to say or something to respond to you can at that moment, it doesn't necessarily have to flow in the circle that's it's been flowing in thus far. But yes, that's a good question. You're really encouraged to say things in conversation rather than in the chat. And if they do need help with anything logistical and like we said before, should we post the questions in the chat, things like that. You can use the side chat for. Some very good question, though. Thank you.", "654": "So again, we want to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and well being in your community. For the purposes of this conversation, we like to invite you to think of your community broadly and share either about your neighborhood community, your social community, or even nowadays, your virtual community because that's a thing. And when you're responding to these questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you're thinking of when you share your story. And so I got a few questions to start us off. We hope this will be a time for some back and forth among you, as you share your stories.", "655": "I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you and they're made by others in the group while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. And so our next question is, what in your community is working well to support your health and well being? And what are some of the people, places or things that positively contributed to your or your community's health and well being? Share a story or experience that will help us understand this a bit better. And I am pasting this into the chat as well. For this, anyone can start but if Ramona you'd like to take the lead, you can.", "656": "That's hard because when I think of my haven ... what's working well to support my health and well being? I don't do any of my health care in this neighborhood. Lincoln Hospital ... I mean if I got shot, it's great. It's recognized as a leading trauma center. So if anybody in your family got shot, it's definitely where you want them to be treated, because that's what they're experts at. We have not had a real community clinic that was not attached to some addiction program. So a meth or rehab center for years, we've had our first clinic open up, an Urban Health Plan, which is a really good organization. They opened up in October, and I thought that I would move my care to here because I love the idea of being able to walk to my doctor. It's something that I had in Hawaii, I could walk to all of my doctors and to a really good hospital.", "657": "But I don't have that here. I suffer from ankylosing spondylitis, which is a autoimmune disease that eats at different parts of you over years and I'm turning 40 this month and it's been 20 years of the disease progressing. And we need a kiddie pool with a 40 is what I keep saying. That's going to be my entire day. But I need a rheumatologist. I need pain management, I need physical therapy, I need ... I'm seeing my surgeon for my salivary gland because I don't make saliva properly. I have arthritis doctor for my eyes. I have one for my body. I can't get that kind of care in my neighborhood. Things that ground me and make me feel well, we don't have a public gym, or a park center. The closest to me is St. Mary's, I can't get there ... I could get there walking but the walk itself because of my limitations would exhaust me.", "658": "I don't have a park in my neighborhood other than St. Mary's, so I tend to walk to our waterfront which is where the city brings all of its trash, they chuck it in and then there's a train that takes it up at night so I walk there sometimes and it's the only beautiful space around here. And once you get past the entrance, if there's no trucks around, it's like you're not in New York anymore. It's right on the river, it's beautiful. I was able to experience spring, it's my dog's favorite place to be. Our supermarkets were [inaudible] which is insane because we're by Hunts Point, which distributes all of the food for New York. So when I try to get produce in my neighborhood, it's more expensive than other neighborhoods and it lasts fewer days.", "659": "So I'm on public assistance because I was sent to disability. And people aren't buying my Mitch baby products like I thought that they would be. But it's just there's ... I talk a lot about the stuff all the time, right? My community is ... we don't have the infrastructure that at least I've experienced living in DC, living in Hawaii, living in other cities. It just ... I don't think that anything is being done well. I was on the Close Rikers Committee for the South Bronx because we're getting a new jail here and we negotiated a community hub. We are still trying to negotiate access to the waterfront and a park space. We're trying to get funding for sports spaces. We don't have any of that. So I'm like the worst person to start with.", "660": "No. Thank you for your input though. That's also important that you share your feelings about that. Well, so thank you for sharing again. Jasmine, you want to go? Or if anyone has anything to say or respond or anyone has anything that they want to comment on what Ramona said, please do. We don't necessarily have to go in that circular order.", "661": "Yeah, this is Lynne. So Ramona, I hear you loudly and clearly. I know that the baseline of what you've been experiencing is now even magnified because of COVID. And really more magnified because of what we're going through with the racial tensions. I would just encourage you to ... and I think it's an issue across the board where, if you have an underlying illness, you are baseline scared, but really scared now because doctors aren't seeing patients, etc, etc. So I would say that ... I feel like I'm on the opposite end of that, especially with the access to medical care and being able to assist the population. And that's one of what we do ... a part of what we do is to go into communities and to teach and provide resources for members. So I would just say, don't be discouraged, and that there are resources and I'm definitely willing to help you navigate that and do some of the work. So just don't be discouraged.", "662": "Thank you Lynne. Would anybody like to go next?", "663": "I can share. I live in the Bronx and similar to Ramona, there aren't many options for people in the Bronx. And for me to get quality food, I have to drive to Yonkers or go to Trader Joe's and downtown. So that's something that's challenging, but as a positive in the communities that I work, I do find that my programs are a positive thing that exist for community members, especially my school based programs because we provide mental health supports for families. So I see that as something that's very useful and beneficial to families in Brooklyn. And oftentimes, when we have students that we do referrals for, for mental health services or families that we do referrals for, they usually don't go because of whatever fears they have, or because of the scheduling. So it's nice that we are able to provide in school, mental health services where families do not have to go outside and they already have a trusting relationship with the clinicians that we have on our programs, so that's something positive.", "664": "And also at my community centers, specifically our Butcher Community Center, experience lots of violence, and when the community is hurting, that is a central location where people gather to grief but also find support from one another. So that's something that I find very positive for the health of community members. And what we do is that we partner with general health, mental health providers to support the community during the time, as well as during this time, many of my centers are open for food distribution to support families. So that's a positive amongst all the negative things that families are really taking advantage of the food or services that we're providing during this time.", "665": "Okay. I guess it's my turn. So I would say there are three issues. I agree with Kelly when she said that fresh fruits and vegetables and access thereof in neighborhoods like the South Bronx and Harlem really is not the same as it is in the Yonkers, New Rochelle, Mount Vernon area. I will say though that around Montefiore, they have gotten fruit carts, so fresh fruits and vegetables that come in, and I found that to be very helpful in under resourced areas that don't have those ... or that grocery stores don't have it on the shelves or the bodegas may have fruits and vegetables that are not, I would say the freshest. So that's number one, where I see that there's improvement and I've been at Montefiore now for 25 years and it's been ... I've seen that, over the past I would say eight to 10 years and it's been really helpful.", "666": "Number two as far as open air spaces around Montefiore and in Harlem and South Bronx and so forth, as Ramona said, it's not really there. There're double use a lot of times for a toxic purpose, like trash storage or school bus storage or something like that which can promote other issues. I know in Montefiore they started the Montefiore mile. So within the hospital, you can actually exercise by walking this path in the hospital. So that's been very helpful. And then I know that other hospitals have done the same for employees, but of course, I don't know how it is for patients. So that's a challenge that remains. And then if there are open air places, a lot of times you feel safe, especially now. So that's a big question. Yeah, so I think those are the two areas of ... helps. And I realize from this conversation that ... and you all have really inspired me because I am part of the emergency medicine residency at Jacobi and we're actually starting a social medicine program where residents, doctors who are in training from across the country can actually get more involved in the Bronx and address some of these social issues.", "667": "Unfortunately, a lot of them don't understand social determinants. And when patients come to the emergency department, they're not quite sure why they're here. And it's quite clear from what others have experienced who have lived in and around the Bronx, what the situation is, they are not. So I am working very hard leading a group to where we can get 84 doctors who are in training involved in different activities so that they can learn more, but also contribute more. And then hopefully they will pass that ... not only continue throughout their practice, to volunteer for example, in the community, but also pass that along to people that they're training.", "668": "I think that's a really good point. So there's a health center up near Kingsbridge here in the Bronx. So I work a lot with Anita [Reges] who is the director up there, and she and I were having weekly calls since COVID broke out. And that's one of the things that kept coming up for us in the messaging and in the outreach at the city and the Department of Health were doing, and how it was failing the Bronx because we were noticing how it was ... COVID was impacting us at such a higher rate but our community was getting information that didn't really speak to them in a way that recognized who the audience was. And we had a really close neighbor of ours that ended up passing away from COVID. And in my experience with calling the COVID hotline with him, it was so apparent that people on the hotline were truly trying to be helpful. But when I called them and I said he's lived in public housing for about 15 years, that should set off a light bulb. We're in Mott Haven. He had diabetes, he had kidney issues. It was just like this list, right? And I kept being told, \"Well, he's not running a fever. So just wait. Just wait.\"", "669": "And for a lot of our community members, when we would talk to them, it felt like you weren't really ... and I'm talking to the Department of Health. You weren't really listening to this person's entire picture, because the woman that answered my call was a white volunteer. And if you don't understand how living in public housing is already a pre-existing condition, you were giving me the wrong guidance. And I think that we waited more than we should have to take him to the emergency room because there was a lack of awareness at that first triage point, because then when I got through again and I spoke to an Indian ... I think If they were at that point ... after you got through the first stage of talking to the volunteer, then you spoke to a nurse practitioner or someone that was more higher up in training and education. And immediately she's like, \"No, no, he needs to come to the emergency room.\" And we had lost 18 hours.", "670": "So my thing to her was, \"You're putting out information, telling our people, if there's no fever stay home.\" And so many of our people died in NYCHA because they stayed home. And I'm like, \"That's why we died at double the rate.\" It's because you were talking to us like if I was Karen on 86th Street and I'm home in an apartment that doesn't have a leak, that doesn't have a history of lead, that doesn't have a history of asbestos, where there haven't been roaches, where there aren't mice, where ... and you're not taking into consideration all of that underlying stuff. So I think that's really important just in a crisis and just day to day in how doctors ... I will tell doctors of my ... I was seeing the ENT person put me with an allergist and my allergy ... she didn't understand what I meant when I said, \"Well, I live in public housing.\" Because she wanted me to control causes of allergens. She's like, \"Well are there roaches?\" And I'm like, \"Girl, do you not watch the news?\" And she's asking me these questions, super sweet Jewish lady, and she just didn't get it. And I was like, I live in public housing. Regardless of what I do in our apartment, it's there. That comes from that having that experience and having that exposure to this community.", "671": "Thank you Ramona. Jasmine, would you also like to respond to the poll?", "672": "I'll pass.", "673": "So you'll pass or?", "674": "I'm passing, yeah.", "675": "Okay. All right. So the next question is, what are you learning about your community's well being and resiliency in this pandemic, that you would like others to understand? I know a lot of what you already mentioned was we definitely had to deal with that. So if you would like to expand or if you have another story to share, please do. If not, we can pass and we can definitely move on to something else as well.", "676": "I can quickly share. Excuse me, I can quickly share that ... I apologize, that [inaudible 00:46:03]. I'm sorry, I guess I'll skip.", "677": "No it's all good. Go ahead, take your time. Right, we'll get back to [inaudible 00:46:16]. Anybody else has a [inaudible 00:46:17].", "678": "Okay, so I can say that I have staff, like we hire staff from the community. And something that I am very proud to see and happy to see is that when it comes to food distribution, many of my staff, although we don't tell them to volunteer to do door to door distribution to seniors with the developments that we serve. And that's a sign of resiliency, that people have not been defeated by the scariness that exists prior to COVID even because there's violence that exists within our development prior to the situation. And that they are really passionate about supporting their own people, and that they remind me, although I'm not from those communities, how important it is just to keep people first all the time.", "679": "Thank you. Thank you, Kelly. Anyone else? All right. For the sake of time, we're supposed to be here [inaudible] 12:30-ish. So what I'm going to do is actually going to do the highlight section, which is the next question on this list. Basically, bringing the voice of someone who participate in the conversation at Local Voices Network recently. I want you to imagine this person is in the room with us and listen closely to their comments, and then invite you to share any responses or insights that you gained from listening to these comments. I will share this and this is something that we will do as your support in LVN during the conversation, but this is a highlight that I have from a previous conversation that we had with [inaudible] to express and this is a man in Hunts Point sharing about his mom who is a nurse in New York City. Give me one second. I know you're not going to be able to hear it. [silence 00:48:30]. Here we go.", "680": "Well, it's not specifically that she's been sharing with me, she talks to her friends on the phone and I overhear it. She talks about how she has to share a gown with her coworkers. She talks about how she needs to reuse a mask. She talks about that she has to work with five patients a day. So that means that she's really [inaudible 00:49:05]. She's being exposed to a lot of people with the virus. And that scares me because not only is she my family but she has a high chance of getting that virus because she's over exposed to it. And she has to share a gown. That makes no sense. I don't know how to explain this. If she catches the virus and something happens, I don't know if it's going to mild, moderate or severe. I just don't want it to happen. Yeah, that's all I have to say.", "681": "Any thoughts, insights, any reactions, memories that came to mind from listening to this?", "682": "So this is Lynne. That is really heart wrenching. It's heart wrenching on so many levels. And it really illustrates I think ... Yeah, I mean, his statement really illustrates the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of our society. And the ramifications of someone who's so critical in the center of the family, who's an essential worker, frontline worker, how they have to manage at work, and then maintain their home and the risks that they were taking. And not only for themselves, but for their family. So to me that just is heart wrenching and tragic.", "683": "And it's just an illustration of disparities on so many levels that just peeling back the layers of his 32nd comment is something that really has to be dissected very carefully to understand all the layers of what he was saying. And I think what was most heart wrenching was the tone of his voice. You could tell that he was really, really ... he loved his mom very much. And he realized the impact of her going to work every day. What she was doing as far as sharing PPE and how dangerous that was, and the fact that he was torn apart. He didn't want her to walk out the door, but he knew she had to. So yeah, that was powerful.", "684": "Thank you Lynne. Anybody else?", "685": "I thought when he paused, the fact that Max, the facilitator didn't step in made it a more powerful moment, because our first instinct usually is to fill space, right? And when people turn silent, you sometimes want to jump in and say something. And I think one of the strongest things that I've seen facilitating is ... and it's hard for me to do, is sometimes you just have to be quiet and wait for that person to finish because the more they go on, the more meaningful what they're saying can become, because you're not interrupting them.", "686": "Thank you. Jasmine or Kelly, anything else to add?", "687": "Yeah, it just made me really sad because I saw a New York Times video with black boys talking about ... basically telling their parents, \"You did a good job raising me, I'm going to be okay.\" And that made me very emotional when I saw that video. So hearing him say, \"I'm worried about my mom.\" I shouldn't be defeated but it makes me defeated because I'm thinking like, are people really paying attention to the children of essential workers? Besides these rec centers, besides all this other stuff, what does it really mean for our kids when they get back to school having lost a parent because their parent is a hero? So that makes me really sad.", "688": "Thank you. Lynne thank you for joining us. I know you have to sign off and anybody else that can stick around just for a couple minutes, we won't go through the rest of the script. I'll just run through it. And we'll move on just for the sake of time. I know we've got the wrap up already. So if you do have to leave, please do and we can still be in email contact afterwards. All right. Thank you. But thank you Kelly. Jasmine as well. All right. Cool. Well, thank you. So it's me and you, Ramona. I'm just going to let you know that I'm going to stop the recording here. I'm just going to read this final paragraph in our script.", "689": "Okay.", "690": "Which is that just a reminder will happen with the thoughts you share, the requests will be transcribed, indexed and eventually shared with journalists, public officials and participants in the Local Voices Network. It will also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Department of Health. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voices Network. If you want to convene another group of friends or participate or know others who want to participate, please go to opm.org, and thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts.", "691": "Welcome to this conversation of Cortico Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I began recording at this time and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation.", "692": "First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to create, connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which will uplift the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers and members of the media. So this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation.", "693": "Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories, our |lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation you're invited to share your stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community, rather than share any personal health information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project.", "694": "At Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible for the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consensus a cortical, the operator Local Voices Network to use the recording in accordance with this mission of fostering conversation and communities in the media and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website or be broadcast in the local radio station or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media.", "695": "So please only share what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree. I'll just go around in the order of, I see people in my screen So Jasmine.", "696": "I agree.", "697": "Maria.", "698": "I agree.", "699": "Richard.", "700": "I agree.", "701": "Reggie.", "702": "I agree.", "703": "Awesome. Thank you all. We wanted to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation and support these goals. We have a few guidelines for our conversation, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Allow others time to speak for themselves, share the time and allow others to finish speaking. So take turns, stay curious and ask questions. Pause to take time for reflection, if necessary, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact and one caught possible calls all in the study programs, applications, notifications, and put your phones on silent. Also, I'd add to that, just to mute yourselves when you aren't talking just to avoid feedback, is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you would like to add or change?", "704": "Alright, cool. Let's do it. So, for the easiest first general conversation, we're going to use a modified circle process where each personal take a turn. In the order of the people I saw on the screen, we can use that order. So it would be Jasmine, Maria, Richard, and Reggie, in that order, I posted but for the sake of time, let's not. Again, you can always pass or ask us to come back to you, but for this conversation specifically, we can just go use a little bit of a back and forth message. If you hear anything that you resonate with, feel free to respond to that.", "705": "So let's do introductions first. So your first name, in addition to your first name or first name or pseudonym name, and then a little bit of background info about who you are, where you live, what you do and about you. So just as we did an attorney earlier, let's repeat that for the sake of this conversation. I'm [inaudible 00:03:44], I'm with Local Voices Network, I am a community builder here and I was born and raised in New York, Brooklyn, specifically. And my value that's important to me is, understanding. Understanding and communication because we can communicate, but understanding and then taking time to understand is what's really important to me. I'll pass to you Jasmine.", "706": "Hi everyone. So my name is Jasmine I'm with mixed [inaudible] organization and I'm the health outreach worker. And for me, the value for today is going to be commitment.", "707": "Hi everyone. My name is Maria [inaudible 00:04:28]. I work with the OMERS Community Partnership. I'm the director there. I was born in Columbia and came here to the city of New York when I was around five years old. So a long time ago. So I consider myself a new Yorker, all my life raised in [Corona] and I work there now. So full circle. Value, inclusivity, diversity.", "708": "Everybody, my name is Rich. Sorry about that. I don't know if you could hear, but that was my email. I'm a marketing specialist and employment representative for a young adult Institute in the Bronx. I was born in the Bronx, raised in the Bronx, but I went to college in Florida. So I spent six years, well, two years after college as well. I spent six years in Florida before coming back to New York. And my value, as I said earlier is accountability. I think everybody, at a certain age should definitely just understand just the repercussions and the consequences of their actions.", "709": "I go or.", "710": "Yep.", "711": "Hi everyone. My name is Reginald [inaudible 00:05:54]. You guys can call me Reggie from Long Island, but now reside in the Bronx since 2014. I made the move out here to gain independence and for more opportunities. I'm sorry. I'm a community events coordinator, I worked for a health system, Montefiore Medical Center, but I'm also one of the lead community events coordinator for the New York City Kiki Ballroom Scene. And my value is honesty. I feel like a lot of times people within the LGBT community were not as honest and open with our health concerns and which makes us not get the best service. So I value honesty.", "712": "Perfect. And thank you everybody for sharing. So the next thing we'll like to do is just invite you to share a little bit about yourself. And since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing, I'd like to invite you to take a minute, to think about what health and wellbeing look and feel like to you. So, you can think of a time, a place or a story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. Some things to consider and think about are, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness and how did you feel?", "713": "So we'll go around one at a time to share our stories and just remember it's being recorded. So we ask that you not disclose any sensitive, personal health information that you're not comfortable with sharing or use the names of other people in your story. Okay. I'll let you go first, Jasmine and take some time if you need to.", "714": "Yeah. Can I say like two more minutes. If anyone can go, please feel free.", "715": "Go ahead.", "716": "Go for it. Go for it, please. So health and wellbeing, right. I'm trying to think, I think a moment where I've have felt my best in relation to health and wellbeing is when I have access to the time to exercise and to think about my mental health. I think that sometimes because of the lives that we live, we are always so busy working and providing for our families and sustaining ourselves and our livelihoods that we put our wellbeing in the back burner. And so the times that I felt the best is when I really organize myself and I sit down and I put myself first. So if that means going outside for a walk, if that means reading a book, if that means ... and I find that, that even helps my physical health.", "717": "I find that when I'm stressed or when I'm anxious, I'm finalizing grad school. So always around finals, I get sick and I correlate that with high stress levels. I feel like health and wellbeing are very interconnected in my personal life. And if I am sick physically, I know that it's because I'm not taking care of myself, emotionally and mentally. So yeah.", "718": "Jasmine, did you want to go now or did you [crosstalk 00:09:47]?", "719": "Thank you. So the time that I felt the best in terms of my health and wellbeing, I think it was last year when I took my final exam. And, I think at that moment I felt great finally. And, in finding I had the time, as Maria mentioned, to read a book, to sleep more hours, because that was really hard to get enough sleep, and really eat more healthier and exercise. And I remember at the time, it felt so much weight like went off. So it was so much, it was happiness to know that I was done with school. So alright. You can go.", "720": "Thank you. And the first thing that I think about when I think about the topic health wellness, I guess is a testimony. So I used to play high school basketball in obviously high school, and I think around my senior year, I started to get sick. So I could count on every single year, since my senior year in the winter time, I could count on getting sick twice a year, whether it was both times in December, whether it was once in November and once at the end of winter time, probably in January, I could always count on getting sick twice in the winter season, which coincided with when I played basketball.", "721": "I was of the belief that I just had a weakened immune system after not really playing sports so much as a kid. So that pretty much followed me even after I stopped playing basketball competitively. And most recently I've adopted pretty much a 95% of vegan diet. So I started that in January of 2019 and when the time came and I was definitely expecting something to come around again and I have not been sick. And I'm not usually one to do any type of praising unless I do my own fair share of research and I've done none. I've done no research into the health effects of being vegan, but all I know is from personal experience, just adopting that type of lifestyle. So I know that sometimes I slip up, I may have milk or anything like that, but that lifestyle is, I pretty much attribute that to why I haven't been sick this past winter season. So that's what I think of health and wellness, just the decision to go vegan, not full vegan, but 95% vegan and just the positive effect that's had on me.", "722": "Hi everyone. So when I think about this question, I think about the first time I had to get tested for HIV. I remember while growing up, I was always not comfortable with my provider, being that my provider was very close to my mother. So I was always scared to say some of the things that I was doing, and I think it was ... not that I think, but it was when I came to the job corpse and the stop one shop corpse in around 2014. And it was like mandatory for us to get tests. And I was just like, \"Oh my God.\" And I remember at first being scared, but I remember just getting the results feeling very relieved and feeling like, \"Wow, this was not that bad.\"", "723": "And I felt like I can, open up more to my provider on some of the things that I was doing. So I felt very free at that time and then obviously getting a lot of education because I had a family member that had HIV. So I had all these stigmas in my head. But yeah, I think I felt the most well when I received the results and felt like I could be honest and open.", "724": "Thank you. Yeah. Thank you all again for contributing. We're going to move on to the conversations about your hopes and concerns for your health and wellbeing in your community and for the purposes of this conversation, we'd like you to think of the community broadly. So, whether that be the community that you work with, whether that be your physical location, your community, or your overall community, especially now in the time where a lot of our communities are digital or whatever your definition of community is, bring that with you in this question. So you can share either about your neighborhood community, like social community.", "725": "I got a few questions to start us off with, but hopefully this will be a time for some back and forth among you. If you hear anything you resonate with, please feel free to chime in. And I invite you to responsive points that resonate for you when they're made by others in the group. When your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing and what are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing, if possible, share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a bit better.", "726": "Does anybody go or?", "727": "Yeah, anybody can start?", "728": "I feel like my hopes are that, no matter where you get your medical, whether it's in a non-clinical setting, wherever you feel the most comfortable to receive your type of health, whether it's our non-clinical setting or a clinical setting, my hopes are that a lot of people, part of my community don't get mis-gendered, which turns them away, or get shunned upon for whether they're parents, the way they're acting or stuff like that. So that's my hopes and concerns for, I guess, my community and NYC LGBT community.", "729": "And, I don't really have any concerns. I wanted to share one more thing, I felt like I like when there are workshops integrated with education, for instance, when I was in the certified medical assistant, there was a 10 week program that I learned about stigma around HIV and STIs. And like I said, I had a family member that was going through it a while back, and I just felt like that workshop really helped me have a better understanding around stigma and around just HIV and STIs.", "730": "Thank you. Anyone else?", "731": "Yeah. So in my community and when I think of my community, I'm fortunate to live and work in my community. I've been here for 20 plus years. I think that it's really challenging for my community to be able to navigate the systems that they need in order to take care of themselves and their health. And I'm a firm believer that a strong social capital is needed in my community specifically to help navigate health systems. We have very, I don't want to say unique because you see them across the board, but my community has a lot of language and accessibility, not being able to understand how to navigate, get health insurance if they even qualify.", "732": "And so a lot of my community isolates themselves. And doesn't really for many reasons really is involved in their health in that way. I meet neighbors that haven't gone to the doctor in like 10, 15 years, or they do it when they get the opportunity to go back to their countries because it's cheaper. They don't have insurance here. And then, my undocumented community that not only is unable to access because of language accessibility or any other reason, they can't because they're not eligible.", "733": "They don't have those same rights that we have to navigate the health system. And so, social capital is important because a lot of in my community, because we strive to be resilient and to help one another there's forms and ways that people can get access to health informally. There's a clinic that just popped up that is able to give undocumented women access to health. Just paying a small membership fee a month and navigating those systems. A lot of people do it through informally. So they'll call each other on WhatsApp through Facebook. \"Look, I went to this doctor and she was amazing and you'll have to go there.\"", "734": "And so, I believe that when we take our community out of the isolation that they've been put in, then we can start talking about how we can talk about health for them. Cause I feel like sometimes we always blame our community as to why they're unhealthy. Like eat better and too much salt. [Forign Language 00:20:12] But, there's so many more reasons why our community is lacking in their health. That is not just their eating habits or other habits that they might have.", "735": "Thank you. Thank you, Maria, for sharing. And I would like to echo what you just said. Because I felt like in my community, it really does share similar struggles and challenges, especially with the language barrier. And, I really hope that my community one day gets really basic healthcare. Because I feel like that's something that's missing in my community, especially in the undocumented community. So I really hope that one day we can all get healthcare. So that's something that I really hope one day to see. So that's one for my community. Thank you.", "736": "Thank you, Jasmine. And I'd say my hope for my community it's just that people just continue to educate themselves about what they're putting in their body. I'm not going to try to advocate that everybody becomes vegan because I, myself, I'm not completely vegan. But as far as just general knowledge, like there are certain things that are out that it's almost ridiculous when you do the research of the things that are allowed to be put in certain foods or certain products that we allow to enter our systems. And it could be attributed to a lot of the sicknesses that we otherwise wouldn't have any reasons for having.", "737": "And one of the things that is, in terms of an optimistic sense, one of the things that I am happy to see is the inclusion of more organic foods in our community. Just in a little way, it's just the more options for alternatives, for milk, for example, there are a lot more people who are taking plant-based milks as opposed to milk from animals. And that's just a small step and what we can do from there and just build from that and continue to educate the people in our community. And not even that just give more options, the more options people have, the better they can take care of themselves. Yeah, that's pretty much my overview on the health and wellbeing and the hopes in the community, but it's definitely a good sign to see more diversity for the foods and the products that are presented to us.", "738": "Awesome. Again, thank you all for contributing. For our next question, for the sake of time, try to keep your answers brief, but this is like a deep question. So, if you really have to go and say a little bit more, please do. Well, what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? And again, if you can share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a bit better.", "739": "Can you repeat the question? I'm sorry.", "740": "No problem. The question is, what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand?", "741": "When you say pandemic, you're talking in particular to the COVID, correct?", "742": "Yes.", "743": "Okay. I guess I'll go. What I'm learning about my community is that, a lot of people are either benefiting from the pandemic. When I say that there are just people who are at home, they're not putting themselves at risk and they're making money, whether it's their job paying them to stay home, whether it's unemployment. And so there's that side, people who are benefiting. And then there's the side that people who are not benefiting, people who are not working, especially to touch on what some of the other said, especially the undocumented, we have a food pantry that has probably been the most busiest, even while I'm here. It's probably served at least a 100 people a day. So it's very interesting to see how a lot of people have been affected as far as who can even provide food on the table.", "744": "Because even besides undocumented, a lot of people who have children relied on school breakfast, free lunch, free breakfast. So it's very interesting to see how a lot of people are suffering, from the pandemic who are not even, I wouldn't say that not at risk because they still have to come outside to put themselves at risk to get the food. So it's just very interesting. Yeah, that's all I have to say.", "745": "I wanted to share and I want to echo with what Reggie, what you're saying. I think that, what I've learned in my community is how incredibly resilient they are. Incredible. I knew that because I was undocumented for some years when I first came to this country and living with a single parent for a long time, I understood the resiliency to some level, to some degree, but just now being able to experience it firsthand by witnessing my community and how they rally behind each other. Which is why I think social support is so crucial for my community. They take care of one another in a way that I've never seen before.", "746": "The fact that you have no access to any benefit. We're talking about starvation. You have no job, you have no access to any form of government relief program. You are literally left out to dry and people are still surviving, that is incredibly resilient and they do it because, I'm thankful for the community around them that is rising up and that can help out. Whether it's donating food, local churches are there and popping up and becoming like disaster relief programs out of nowhere. But it stems from understanding that our community is in crisis and that we need to help one another, the neighbor will go out and say, \"Listen, my neighbor is sick and I'm here because I need another grocery box. I have mine, but I need one for my neighbor.\" And they advocate and fight for one another. And so that's what I've learned.", "747": "Yeah, I'll go. I'll say the one thing that I learned in my community, to echo off everybody else's, I guess that sense of community, everybody, when things first ... at least I'll buy in my area and I live by the Hunts Point. The Hunts Point area of the Bronx. So it's a pretty populated area. And I remember when it was first being a protocol for everybody to wear a face mask, it was like one day you see people without face mask. We went to bed the next morning, everybody wore a face mask, at least in my area. Nobody played the games with that. The few times that I did have to travel to get groceries for people in my family that were elderly and couldn't do. Maybe week two or three of the pandemic, I would go out there and I would see maybe one or two people at the whole trip that I was out.", "748": "So it was good to see that everybody took it very seriously, when it was at its biggest threat was the period of the unknown. Well, we didn't know exactly, who it would affect that what the death rate would be, while people were still shooting in the dark, they weren't taking any chances. And that was something that I remember appreciating about living in the community that I did. And I hope everybody else experienced the same thing in their communities where people were just taking everything very seriously because it is still a very serious issue.", "749": "We're all here and hopefully all of us have no negative testimony about this disease affect on our family. There's still people who weren't very negatively affected and we'll look at these months as a life changing event for them. So it was just good to see the people in our community take matters into their own hands and take it very seriously.", "750": "All right. Thank you Richard. So for me, the one thing that I even learned about my community is that despite the lack of support from the government, despite the lack of resources, I feel like our community just came together to support each other. And, that's really amazing to see honestly, and for example, the organization where I work, we decided to fundraise funds. So that way we can support some families. And after so much work, after two months, we actually raised more than $100,000 to help a small number of families. So that's something that I learned and I'll keep learning that my community is very resilient and we got each other's back.", "751": "That is awesome.Thank you all again. So I'm going to move on to our highlight. And so I'm going to bring in the voice of someone who participated in a conversation at Local Voices Network recently, and I want you to imagine that this person is in the room with us and listen closely to their comments. And I'll invite you to share any responses and insights that you gained from listening to this. I will actually share my screen now so that you can see the highlight and this is actually what it would be like in your conversations as well. So I will be here to assist you with this, this highlight is actually from a conversation that we had with Hunts Point, [inaudible] and hum express. And this is a Martin just talking about his mom was at NYC nurse, during this time. So, let's listen.", "752": "Well, it's not specifically to say that she's been sharing with me. She talks to her friends on the phone and I overhear it. She talks about how she has to share a gown with her coworkers. She talks about how she needs to reuse a mask. She talks about that she has to work with five patients a day. So that means that she's really within region. She's being exposed to a lot of people with the virus. And that scares me because not only is she my family, but she has a high chance of getting that virus because she's overexposed to it and she has to share a gown, like that makes no sense.", "753": "I don't know how to explain this, if she catches the virus and something happens, I don't know if it's going to mild, moderate or severe. I just don't want it to happen. That's all I have to say.", "754": "I'm going to leave it to you. So any thoughts, insights, or reactions that you had? Anything that came to mind for this listening to this?", "755": "The first thing that [crosstalk]", "756": "You did as well. So, Jasmine will you go first.", "757": "Oh, okay. So the first thing that came to my mind it's, I wonder how many people are going through the same situation. So that's the first thing that came to my mind and knowing that there's a lot of people who need supplies and they can't afford to took them more. So.", "758": "I can talk. I instantly felt sad, being that I work in healthcare and there's a lot of stories like that for people working in the main hospital, it made me worrisome about protective gear, and also leadership in these clinics. I think it made me, just like him being concerned for his parent, that's working in a situation. I feel like it should be so important for the employer to protect their staff. So the staff can make sure that they give the best care, not only to the patient, but to make sure that they're protected. So they don't also affect the people that are home, which was very scary, for the gentlemen. I just honestly got sad. I am not going to lie.", "759": "I felt indignified and angry. I just feel like there's a normalization of these things and this shouldn't be normal. Like we shouldn't be hearing these kinds of stories and as Jasmine was saying, this is not the first time I've heard something like this. Like how many more? So that's my first reaction, just anger.", "760": "My first thought in terms of what they were having to deal with was, I guess that as I was saying earlier in the conversation accountability, there are people who are in charge of the safety protocol there. So much like Reggie, you mentioned there's somebody who is supposed to pass the law that things like that are unacceptable. And the fact that people actually have to resort to doing things like that. Accountability comes in to question, because I know that that wasn't done out of choice. It was done out of necessity or what they feel was necessity. So the thought of going after, or not going after, confronting who would be in charge basically.", "761": "I just wanted to add one more thing, that you just sparked. I think it's also very important for people to also speak out, because sometimes even bringing it to someone who's above your supervisors, sometimes they don't understand the points of your safety. I think no matter who gives you a paycheck to survive, this is a pandemic of survival. And I feel, especially in healthcare, there's things that I have to say, \"I am not going to do that.\" And I think people should also, because obviously this was a big concern, so I think it's also very important to say no. If you really strongly believe it, because at the end of the day, we are the boss of ourselves.So I think that's really important.", "762": "I agree. 100%. I definitely agree.", "763": "Thank you. Thank you. All valid reactions and responses to that. There's a bit more in our conversation, but I think I'm just going to ask one more question and then, go into the closing because for the sake of time, we're supposed to be done in a few so. My question would be, what would need to change to create in New York city, where everyone can be healthy? And what would a New York city where everyone can be healthy look like? And what would it feel like?", "764": "That's a heavy question.", "765": "Yes, it is.", "766": "That is a pack of question. The first things that come to mind just for the sake of time is, a systemic change in the way that we do things from top down level, from the big guys up there, then make the decisions, to the ones that employ the services. Just making sure there's no question that there is social economic and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels and that it affects our health. And if we can do a way with that, where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals, across the board that if I'm walking down [Corona 00:38:35], in my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to park Avenue or central park in Manhattan. There's going to be no change, same quality of care there. That's the first thing that pops into my head, pops up.", "767": "I was going to say, my answer is actually pretty quick. The first thing that comes to my mind is what can change is I honestly don't know, because of how heavy a question that is and how many different ways that you can answer that correctly. I honestly don't know a right, but what I do know is what we did before it's not going to work. And thankfully, enough people are talking about saying ... I've heard enough people say, \"Things can't go back the way that they were.\" But definitely I'm looking for that followup action from all of us and it all takes accountability with every one of us knowing what we would like to do and what we would like to see moving forward. So yeah, I don't know, but I know that what we did before this pandemic broke out, wasn't working.", "768": "I would have to say I would agree. I first think that healthcare should be free for all people, that's number one. As you can see what this pandemic, it doesn't really care who you are or what kind of insurance you have, and stuff like that. So I would definitely say, for us to have a better healthcare system, I personally feel that healthcare should be free to all. I also feel like there should be maybe better evaluations for just everyone in the system, as far as their beliefs, their culture and their religion. There should be more monthly evaluations. And I feel like, especially with healthcare workers that see a lot of things, I think they should maybe do therapy. I think after this pandemic, a lot of people's mental state will not be the same.", "769": "But just continue, I feel like for us to be in a better space, I feel like the workers need to be in a better space. I think a lot of times health workers keep a lot of things within and there should be more programs or more help for them to do their job at 100%.", "770": "Thank you, Reggie. So for me, I think I can agree with Maria in terms of, I feel like if we're going to have a change, we really need to change our system and I think there needs to be more equity in communities where they need more resources and support. And I feel like the only way that we can improve the wellbeing of our communities is basically having universal healthcare. That's one and free education, high quality education and education that includes everyone's stories, not just one. So yeah.", "771": "Well, thank you everybody. Again, for the sake of time, I think that's going to be our last question. We have a couple more questions about amplifying and what would you pretty much ask your local representatives, but, that's something that you will do in your facilitations and ask the people that you speak with. In closing, it was all the questions we have for you, just a reminder of what will happen with the dots you just share. These recordings will be transcribed index and eventually shared with journalists, public officials and participants in the Local Voices Network.", "772": "They'll also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Department Of Health. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voice Network. And if you want to convene another group of friends to participate or know others who want to participate, please go to lvn.org and thank you so much for sharing your thoughts.", "773": "... the other town halls. I'm just going to dive in because we have limited time, and just say welcome to this conversation. I'm going to hit record. It is recording, actually, which is perfect. Welcome to this conversation of Portico's Local Voices Network in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this conversation. Like I said, I've begun recording at this time.", "774": "I need to just share a little information with you before we actually begin. Following our conversation, the video recording will be discarded, so you don't have to worry about any of that. The audio will become a part of the Local Voices Network collection. There are three purposes for this conversation that Kelly went over at the beginning, so I won't go over them again. I will just say that this conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project. At Portico's discretion [inaudible] to the general public.", "775": "As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations and communities, and in the media, that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation, and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper, or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. Please share only what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to everything I just said, please say I agree, and type your name into the chat box so that we have the order of how we're going to share. I'll go first and just type my name and say I agree.", "776": "I agree.", "777": "I agree.", "778": "I agree.", "779": "I agree.", "780": "Great. I think that everybody has said I agree. And now what we're going to do is just go on to a few general guidelines in this conversation. Do you all know each other by the way? I don't know too much about this group, so if one of you just wants to say a few words about that, I'm just curious if you've all connected in person before.", "781": "There's a couple of us that go to AmeriCorps that's just our regular program. I see Krissika [phonetic 00:03:04], I know Alicia, I don't really know anyone else in the group. So yeah.", "782": "Okay, great. Okay, so you'll get to learn a little bit more about each other today. A few kind of general conversation guidelines that I just wanted to go over before we dive in, first of all speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time and allow others to finish speaking. Take turns. Number four, stay curious and ask honest questions. Number five, pause and take time for reflection. Number six listen generously, assume good intentions, while recognizing that your words have an impact. And number seven, when possible, close unnecessary programs and applications and notifications and put your phone on silent.", "783": "Is everyone on board with these guidelines? You can just say yes. Doesn't matter if we say it in order.", "784": "Yeah.", "785": "Okay, great.", "786": "Yeah.", "787": "Great.", "788": "Yes.", "789": "So, for the ease of this conversation, I know it's kind of awkward sometimes to connect on Zoom and not know if somebody's waiting to speak or wants to chime in. We're actually going to use a circle process, so each person will take a turn in the order we just put in the chat box. And I can remind you all of that order as we go along. Sorry in advance, if I skip your name, feel free to just chime in because there's a lot of people in this call and I don't want to miss anybody.", "790": "But I just wanted to first of all begin with a round of introductions. So, if you just want to share you first name, do not need to share your last name, you can also use a pseudonym if you want to. And in addition to your first name, please share just a little bit of background information about who you are, like where you live and what you do. And then a value that's important to you, and how it's related to what brought you here to this conversation today. So I'll start.", "791": "My name is Alex. I'm the head of the Local Voices Network chapter here in New York City, and a value that's important to me is this community first value, that I actually think is really important to the work that we're doing with this, which invites community members like all of you, to really set the stage for what happens, in our city. It's important to turn to you all as experts. So that's what I have to say, and I will turn it over, to the next person on the list. Who is, sorry. Yold.", "792": "Hello (laughs). I am so sorry, I am making dinner. Could you repeat the question please?", "793": "Yeah, totally. So just your name, and then a value that is important to you. And you don't even need to mention your last name, just your first name.", "794": "Okay, I'll do first and last just because it's there. Hi everyone, my name is Yold Delias [phonetic 00:06:28]. A value that is important to me is transparency, and like throughout communication.", "795": "Great, and Barbara?", "796": "Hi, I'm Barbara. And what is important to me...I guess for me it's loyalty.", "797": "Great. And Astu [phonetic 00:07::08]?", "798": "Hi, my name is Astou. I guess a word is community. Like for me, community because my community has raised me to be who I am today. And gave me experiences, and I feel like my identity suits my community, since I've been around it.", "799": "Um, and I have to apologize, this is actually in our script, but if anybody wants to include your pronouns, please do so in introductions as well. And feel free to post it in the chat box if you didn't get an opportunity to share.", "800": "Aislee?", "801": "Hey everyone, my name is Aislee. I am currently the AmeriCorps assistant director with Grand Settlement. [inaudible] AmeriCorps people in here, that's great. I would choose for value, autonomy or agency. I think it's very important during this time. And she/her/hers pronouns.", "802": "Great, thanks. Alia?", "803": "Looks like Alia is no longer on the call, so we'll jump over to -", "804": "She said her mic is broken. She's typing inside the chat.", "805": "Oh. Okay. She'll type it. Unfortunately we're just getting the audio for this conversation, so if she types it, one of us will just read it and that's fine. But as we're waiting, Kriska?", "806": "I would say communication. Something that's very important in the community because we need to know, we all need to be on the same page. So yeah.", "807": "Great. And Xavier?", "808": "What's up everybody. I'll say community and solidarity. I'm Xavier, e-series, and did I miss the other question? Is there another question?", "809": "No, that's the question. Value. Barbara?", "810": "Oh, I went already.", "811": "Oh, okay great. So, next thing that we're going to do is share a little bit more about yourself. And since we're going to be talking about health and well-being today, which is a big topic that I think that we're all coming to from different angles. I'd like to just invite you to take a minute and think about what health and well-being looks like and feels like to you.", "812": "So just kind of think about that in your head just for a moment. And then I want you to just think of a time, place, or a story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. So what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, and what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at that time, and how did you feel?", "813": "And we're going to go around one at a time and share our stories, so please remember this is being recorded, we just ask that you don't disclose any sensitive personal health information, or use the names of other people when telling your stories. And I'm actually going to step back in this moment, as the moderator, and just hold the space for all of you to be able to share in this moment. So feel free to share however you would like. We don't have a ton of time right now, but I want to make sure you spend some time thinking about this question, and I'll repeat it.", "814": "Actually, why don't I just post it in the chat. That probably makes sense. So you're going to think of a time, a place, or a story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, and what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time. How did you feel?", "815": "So I'm going to post that there. It looks like a ton of questions but it's really just one question. So, I'm going to actually point to, we'll actually start with Yold again. So if you want to go first.", "816": "Hi everyone. So, where I felt I was at my best in terms of health and wellness, I would say last year around this time. Well, just in general. But the springtime/summertime, I just feel better because sun's out, knees are out. I felt really good cause I was on, I was taking my medication regularly. I was eating really well, I'm plant-based so I was actually eating plant-based (laughs). At the time, I was exercising regularly. I found something that I really liked, I really enjoyed doing yoga and I really got into it last year, it's just like fun to find something new and exciting and challenging to do. And I felt really supported by my community, at that time last year I was so serious about my bed time. Like 10:30 every night. And even if I was up, out and about, at like 10:10, my roommates/friends would be like um, yo it's almost you're bedtime and you're not getting ready for bed so, what's up? So they really held me accountable to my wellness goals or routines, or what have you.", "817": "And, I felt like I was going to therapy regularly I always had the outlet to say how I feel, I had tools to understand how I felt and like reflect on it. And I felt really alive. Super [inaudible] extremely vibrant and alive, like a lot of life force (laughs). I woke up wanting to be awake you know. I went to bed excited to wake up in the morning.", "818": "Thank you so much for sharing. Barbara?", "819": "Hi, okay so. Mine would have to be about, what year are we in? 2020 is being thrown away at this point. But, probably about four years ago, so 2016. I had just started with, I actually worked through AmeriCorps, and stayed with AmeriCorps for a little while. And then transitioned to another organization, on to Grand [phonetic] Street. So when I first started, it was very nerveracking because even though I worked with students in middle school from before it was a little, a lot of time I had lots in between. So me getting back into the classroom was very nerveracking. And they were middle schoolers you know, everything is more self revolved around them, so it's just kind of like, okay. The attitudes are coming up high, and definitely the culture, out of Harlem, so definitely a difference in any of the boroughs, when I experienced it.", "820": "And after I got acclimated and my other peers helped me and they basically gave me some guidance and stuff like that, some of the students, a lot of the students started to come around and they really gravitated towards me I guess. And even the ones that [inaudible] like after I left that school, and I still visited because I was building that rapport with the other teachers and became really cool. Even when I would go back and visit, I would get like huge hugs and even students that seemed like that they didn't really like me or were very standoffish at times, still like embraced me at that point once they transitioned to high school. It felt like everything that I was saying and even though they didn't understand everything from the full capacity that I was telling them and guiding them, as they get older, and kind of showing them that mentorship that I have. It kind of clicked and when they did come back to me and visit, it was like, oh I understand what you mean when you said what you were saying.", "821": "So I think that, those moments, are highlights. And it happens every so often and I feel like within our professions we don't always get that gratification and it's definitely not an instant thing. But it definitely does come back in full circle.", "822": "Great, thank you so much for sharing. Just looking... Astu? (Silence)", "823": "We can come back to you, Astu. If you're not ready to share.", "824": "Okay, Aislee?", "825": "There's two Astu's in the chat right now, so I think Astu and [inaudible] is waiting. To see which one is going to be.", "826": "Yeah this too, my cousin and then there's me.", "827": "Oh, okay. Okay. Astu, let's do Astou N.", "828": "Okay, that's me. I feel like there's never an okay time, or like a good time no matter what's going on. Cause I grew up traveling, to like schools in different country that has like, embraced, they never like the okay stage. Cause I always had to like, I was always the oddball. I was never like, could embrace everything. Not like, like the best, I guess, I was close to good I could say like last year.", "829": "Cause a kid ran, [inaudible] the city, school in the city. I was like okay, and after like, you always have to worry about something else no matter what it is. It's honestly the biggest thing to like, I don't really know. So that's where I stand on this.", "830": "Yeah, it's a tricky question. Sometimes to think about. Astu T?", "831": "Could you repeat the question please?", "832": "Yeah, so the question is in the chat too if anybody has any questions about it but just think about a time, place, or story where you felt like you were really at your best in terms of health and wellness.", "833": "I feel like, I don't know. I feel like there's never really been a time where I was completely, 100% fine. I feel like there's always something going wrong, which is like you know, life. And I have to learn to deal with it but the closest I can get is...I really can't think of anything. I really don't know.", "834": "Um, and I should also mention that you can also say pass to any of these questions. That's definitely an important part of this conversation so, please feel free to take a pass if you need one. So let's turn to, Aislee.", "835": "Yeah, I would say my peak was definitely senior high school. I think that has to do a lot with [inaudible] spiritually, emotionally, physically, I think I was on it. More committed and disciplined but, I have my moments in adulthood. Where I feel like I'm at the peak, but it's just all about balance now. Yeah definitely, twelfth grade. It was awesome.", "836": "Thank you. Alia? Your microphone I think is not working so if you want to type in the chat feel free and I can just read it out loud. And as we're waiting for you to do that, I'm going to go to Krissika.", "837": "Hi, so I don't have a particular favorite, particular day that made me happy but when I go to the pier by my house that's when I feel like happy and calm, because it's my getaway place from everything. And yeah. That's it. So like every time I go to the pier I'm fine, I take my phone with me and listen to music, and like just empty my brain of all the negative stuff.", "838": "Yeah, I love the idea of having a getaway place. I need one of those. Xavier?", "839": "A time for me that was, I would like to say, I guess right before I went for my graduate program. I had a lot of stuff going on overall with work, home, and stuff like that so I need to hone in so I would say like during that time in 2015. 2017 was a time of balance and spirituality for me, and a lot of that has gotten me to this day so like that has probably been one of those stepping, can you see me do air quotes, sorry. Has done one of those \"stepping blocks\" to be who I am today, so I'll go with that.", "840": "Great. Thank you, thank you for letting us know about the air quotes (laughs). So let's see, I think that, I apologize if not everyone has gone, if you would like to add to your story or if you haven't shared please feel free to speak up now.", "841": "All right. So the next thing we're going to do is move into a more of, oh and Alia actually just shared that time, place or a story when she felt that she was at her best in terms of health and wellness.", "842": "\"The summer before I went to high school because I started to be more independent and I got my first job and it was a great time for me\".", "843": "Thank you. So the next part of this conversation is actually going to be a conversation, I don't just want to do the go around circle practice. So feel free to chime in when you feel like chiming in. And I still encourage you all to share from your own personal experience, this is a definitely more of a conversation focused on sharing stories than a typical town hall style meeting. So please definitely continue to do that. But I want to just think about community, a little bit more broadly right now. I know all of you shared bits and pieces of community health in your personal stories just now, but I want you to think about your hopes and concerns for health and well-being in your community.", "844": "And your community could be your neighborhood, it can be your social community, so think about it however you would like to. And when you're responding to questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, just please share about that community that you're thinking about when you share.", "845": "So I've got a few questions to start us off. But we hope that this will also be a time for some back and forth, like I was saying, as you share your stories, and please if you hear somebody say something that you can connect to, or you want to build on, or you have questions about, feel free to chime in at any point.", "846": "So the question that I have for you and I'll put it in the chat, right here is, what in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being. And if you could just share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "847": "So again the question is, what in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? And what are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being. And please share a story or experience that will help us understand this a little bit better.", "848": "So does anybody want to kick this off? Does anybody have anything to share around this?", "849": "I can start.", "850": "Great.", "851": "Can you hear me? You kind of cut out a little bit.", "852": "I can hear you now.", "853": "Hello?", "854": "Hello?", "855": "Can you hear me?", "856": "Yes.", "857": "Okay, do you mean a physical community?", "858": "Community however...", "859": "Okay, cool. So I'll start with physical, one thing that's been helping me is just shopping at my local mom and pop grocery store. It's just been nice, I feel like I have a wider range of fruits and vegetables to like choose from, and they're really nice and they know me and I'm just like excited to try a new fruit or vegetable. I always have dried apricot, I've never had an apricot, like a real live off the tree apricot, so that was fun. And it's just been really cool trying new things.", "860": "Let's see. I think, I follow this Black vegan chef, and she has a 'gram called Sweet Potato Soul, and I just love her. She has really cool recipes, and it's just like fun to me to like find a new recipe, go to the store I was just telling you about, buy all these news things, so I told you right now I'm making dinner. I'm making this beet fennel salad, and I literally had to look up how to cut fennel because I've never touched a fennel bulb in my life. Which is so much fun right, like just trying new things figuring out which food you like and you don't like. So, that's really supported my health because it's just like, I'm eating better, it makes it fun. I really trust this woman (laughs).", "861": "Every time she emails us the newsletter I'm like whatever you say, ma'am. I will eat whatever recipe you put in front of me, I don't care if I've never heard of this before, I'm going to eat it because I know it's going to be delicious.", "862": "But yeah, and then yeah. I'll stop there. Thank you.", "863": "That's so great, such a great research project. I love it. If anybody else, well I'm just going to kind of open the floor to anybody else who has a story you'd like to share about something that's working well in your community to support your health and well-being.", "864": "I'm just going to kind of make it even more specific too if anybody has anything that you'd like to share you know connected to right now, like what's been going on during the pandemic, could be pre-pandemic, like whatever you want to share. That has affected your health and well-being, in a positive way during this time in your community. Whatever you think of as your community.", "865": "I guess I'll speak. It's Barbara. So within my community I'm glad that I do live near a Target so, Target has been open and it's been very convenient for me access even with everything going on and the people seem nicer. I don't know, [inaudible] but yeah, they seem pretty much nicer. I don't know what else is going on as far as like, if there's any food distribution or different types of pantries or anything in that sort but I do know for this, the school location where I work at I actually volunteered this week doing food distribution outside of course, doing social distancing and it was really cool because other people from different schools also volunteered and just seeing faces, along with seeing some of the students. Cause I know both elementary as well as middle, so it was like one of those ah moments. You know you get to see them and they get to see you.", "866": "And I was just kind of light and refreshing, and it kind of took away from everything else that was going on as far as like the protests, and the pandemic of COVID, as well so. Yeah it was just, nice being outside in the sunlight. Everything isn't normal, I don't know what will be normal exactly, but it was just nice to be outside where you can still see some of the kids still out there and trying to cope as best as we as adults are coping.", "867": "Great, great observations. Does anybody have anything that you'd like to share that is connected to what Yold or Barbara shared or anything that is specific to your community experience?", "868": "All right, the only person I can actually see right now is Astou N. So I can't see anybody else's face, it's a very odd experience, but I'm just kind of wondering if any of you who are behind your computer right now, feel free to chime in if there's anything else you want to add to this question.", "869": "Okay. I know that a couple of you, I think this was mentioned at the beginning have a AmeriCorps, so I'm just curious about the part of being part of a community right now of people who are actively kind of extending yourselves in your community and what that's like. Being people who are actively kind of giving back to your communities in different ways during this times. I'm just curious about what that's been like for you.", "870": "All right so, it's Astou N. For me, I feel like, me and my AmeriCorps, like one of my AmeriCorps supervisors, she's in the chat, obviously. She's like, she used to be like, my counselor, I don't know how to explain it, with coping. But like she has given so much. I've seen what she has done, I grew up with her as one of my role models. Literally looking at her and I see how she gave back to so many people and how she impacted most of us AmeriCorps members. I grew up learning my community is where you can go, you can go for anything.", "871": "I feel like, me having that as a kid, that was the best thing for me. Because I didn't grow in a house where our parents couldn't speak fluent English, anything i needed to understand. So having that was like amazing for me. And me giving that back to a kid that I know they're going to take this and they're going to be like this is the moment that I needed. This is something that I couldn't really have at my household, or whatever. It is my family who really didn't understand the experiences I had been going through, so having that was amazing for me, and to give it back to someone else is like handing down.", "872": "My community raised me so much to be the person I am, I'm willing to give back so much back into it. Refining and renewing the new generations to have the same experiences that I could have had. That was the best thing for me, to have that experience. And for me, like having my kids and giving back to my community helped me grow as a person, more than I already have, like high school is high school, middle school, education is education but having that human experience that made me grow even more, even more breakthrough.", "873": "I'm realizing how much effort goes into it and like how much effort was put into me as a person.", "874": "Thank you so much. Aislee? Aislee I see that you've unmuted yourself, so I just wanted to invite you to share if you had anything to share.", "875": "I just have this facilitator prospective of that. I've definitely seen Astu grow, and for many years now. But I feel like when we bring up community our AmeriCorps community and culture is one of the strongest, along with Petesall [phonetic 00:35:40], I think. Simply because we just care, and there's a lot going on right now in the world, as far as multiple types of pandemics and how our identity plays into that. And I feel like when you have a strong team of people who can relate and maybe not everything, but most of the things you go through where often in New York City, it's a very chaotic time and it fosters some sort of resiliency to give back and to create magic for others.", "876": "So what Astu is kind of speaking of is the AmeriCorps members in our group they have job training, workshops with myself and Hannah, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and Monday, Wednesday, Friday they'll go into Grant Street youth sites to create magic with those kids based off what they learned at the workshop so I can already see that Astu has impacted and become the champion to some of those youth. And some of those youth right now are basically currently facing hunger, and evictions, and all of these other you know, hard times. So when you can even, Astu you mentioned it the other day, you can just have someone text you and be like, \"Yo, I miss you\" or \"I'm okay\", like that's enough. It just makes you feel like you're doing everything you can to just make sure everyone around you is set. So that's my piece on it. I just want to make sure they're good.", "877": "Great.", "878": "I feel like for me, I don't know, this is making me kind of emotional. But for me, I know like I did something where it came to a point where my kids, that were really little, like 7 or 6 years old, calling me like oh my god I miss you, and then I'll be like oh [inaudible] something was going on. They first called me and they're trying to explain to me like, oh you know how it is, you know how it is. And I'm like, how can you at the age have that growth?", "879": "It came to like, last week one of my kids, \"oh we don't have no food in the house because I'm so used to going to school\". And I'm like, oh wait I got you, I'm close. I'm not that far, I live in Harlem, and they're in the Lower East Side, so I was like all right. I went to the supermarket, it's so bad. It's hard to watch it, younger kids go through that. For them to know they can call me, like that just showed I impact them so much and they impact me, because I'm like dang this is, they really need this, because without us, where do they go?", "880": "They have no other support system. We are the people that they look up to, so everything I do is like, they looking it at ten times harder, they looking at it from a whole different perspective. So like, it changes how you want to react to certain things and understand it just puts you in a different position compared to your everyday, oh that's fine, oh this is okay, it's different. You're looking and you have to, you can be here for your community it's okay. You can be there at the best times, but when they really need you, like when it hits rock bottom, and like real close to rock bottom. It's just like how much are you willing to give back to the place that technically is like where you're going to turn. Once everything is done, these are the moments they remember. It's not the moments that, they're going to remember the happy moments but they're also going to remember the worst moments at the time because you're going to always write the good parts over there, but you're going to remember the bad times.", "881": "And like whoever is there for you, or what you remember the most. When you think back, like 20 years from now, when they're 25 or 26, 18, 16, they're going to be like, I want to be like that, cause that was there when I had nothing.", "882": "Yeah. Thank you so much for sharing, that is such a powerful statement to think about. To think about how we're all learning so much about the depths of our communities, whatever our community is, our community's resiliency and strength during this time. And how important people like you Astu, and so many other people on this call, this Zoom room are to other people in your community, and how much you know kind of weight that bears.", "883": "Can anybody else connect to what Astu just shared about what she is learning about her community right now during this time?", "884": "I definitely agree with Aislee and the AmeriCorps worker in a stable group amount of people behind you, at the end of the day, when we came together it was all about AmeriCorps. Like we positioned together and was able to overcome it and it's just like, it opens up their eyes like if you guys could do this for a whole bunch of people that you didn't know at that point, you can do it with people that you know and who you live with, and who you're around. Nothing like when you know you have people behind your back, and you communicate, and we all learn to be together it can be like a very beautiful thing.", "885": "Great, thank you for sharing. Is anybody else part of a team in your community? A group of people that you feel like is really supporting your community's well-being and resiliency during this time?", "886": "Okay, not sure whether you know it or not but you all are certainly part of that. I just want to ask another question connected to a lot of what's being shared right now, which is what are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? So you know think about something that you would really, really like for people to understand about your community's well-being and resiliency during this pandemic time.", "887": "And not everybody has to answer this, but just throwing it out, as something to respond to if you have something to say. Astu?", "888": "Oh, I'm put on the spot. For me I feel like, what I want people to know is that my community, cause like my community is unbreakable. We have like an unbreakable bond, but sometimes we need other people from other communities that has the resources to come in and help. Yeah we're all together, yeah we're going to scrap together, we're going to do whatever together, no matter how hard it gets we're always going to be together.", "889": "But sometimes other communities, everyone is created whole, no matter where you are, you're still a part of a community. Even if it's like on the other side of the world, you're still part of that community. Cause we're like, we're under the whole human race, like we're a whole community and one. But I feel like, they need to understand we're unbreakable and we might not show when we're at our weakest but you can tell when people are at the weakest, or when they need help. And never to be afraid to give a helping hand cause I feel like people are too afraid of their image like, oh I'm going to be hanging around with those people, they going to think I'm one of them. And it's not like that. It's like, kids around my age, are like too worried about the image, you have to try to be around a group or helping the group.", "890": "They not thinking about the positives, they thinking about being seen with them. They need to just put that ego aside and give a helping hand. To be honest.", "891": "Does anyone else have anything to say on this question?", "892": "Okay. I'm going to go on to the next question, just for the sake of time, we only have ten minutes left which is crazy. I just wanted to ask you given what's been shared in our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would it feel like? I know that is a big question but, if you you know, can kind of just imagine what a healthy New York City would look like. And feel like. What would that look like to you?", "893": "You don't even have to imagine the whole city, cause that's kind of a daunting task, even if you just wanted to think about what your community would look like.", "894": "Um, I see a healthy New York as accessible food and wellness, you know. I would love to see Whole Foods quality produce literally everywhere. I shouldn't have to go to Whole Foods to get Whole Foods quality produce, you know? It should already be in my neighborhood. I shouldn't have to venture out for it. And I think just like exercising, like gyms, should be cheaper, right?", "895": "There should be an incentive for gyms to be like a lot cheaper or like more community events that are sponsored by the city or whatever. Just making health and wellness that is essentially almost only for you know, those who can afford it accessible to everyone. Because everyone deserves a quality exercise class, just because you can't afford it, you know, at this time, doesn't mean you don't deserve a fun challenging exercise that makes you feel better about yourself. Everyone deserves that, right. And it shouldn't be a paywall between that.", "896": "Yeah, that is a really great point. Does anybody have anything to add to what Yold said, or even if you want to agree with something Yold said emphatically, go for it.", "897": "Yeah, Astu.", "898": "I definitely agree with where she's coming from. I feel like we're so used to giving a lower, like, companies...I don't know how to put this. Like, I'm sorry but half-assed things. And we're not like willing to understand. Like, my community is getting gentrified cause I live in Harlem. [inaudible] house and then they multiplied. Like I realized that ever since the gentrification started, there's been more like, oh this free yoga class, oh there's this here oh there's that here. But now that the money is coming in they want to supply all these efficient things like healthy living, cause there was never a fresh fruit unless you're going to the carts or stuff like that.", "899": "There was never that, there was never like oh vegetarian or vegan option for my community. There was like the cheapest, there was certain things they just never had, until gentrification began. And like, in communities that are still low income, they should have like efficient things to go exercise, go like find fresh fruits and produce, instead of going to the supermarket and having to look and be like I'll buy the apples for $5, okay but this bag of chips is $5 too. I want them to have the option of what they can eat and what they put in their body at an efficient price. Most of the fruit it's so disappointing that most of the food in America gets thrown away like, the ugly peaches, the ugly apples, that can go right back in our communities and use as like resources for like our people. Healthy eating. I'm glad like Citi Bikes, are doing a $5 if you live in Nightshaw [phonetic] or you have like support or whatever thing. For like a healthy living lifestyle but at the end of the day that's still like a [inaudible 00:48:36]. Because people are looking like, oh this $5 I could have been doing this, I could have been doing that.", "900": "There should be more community centers, like open that are like come in to this hip-hop class for free on Friday, or come to this dance or just come to the gym and play basketball for a little bit. And I feel like sometimes they restrict the age for people who are going in the community, like oh you have to be, they focus on a lot of younger kids I'm glad that's happening, but even the elders who need a little dance class or this or that something to interest them that they need to go out and exercise. Cause that's a big thing. Like where can you exercise if all you can do is walk, you're going to get bored eventually and want to do something else.", "901": "So that's why more resources for healthy living, healthy lifestyle.", "902": "Great, thank you for sharing. So many great ideas. Does anybody else have anything to add? To what was shared on this question. Around what, a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like. Some of the topics that came up from Yold and Astu, where around access and making sure that you know we could rely on food and exercise and things that are needed for our bodies to be healthy that are not ridiculously expensive and accessible in our communities.", "903": "Yeah I agree with all that as well. And I think that um, I still kind of like play a little devil's advocate like, if everything was \"back to normal\", air quotes, would this still continue? Would there be these additional resources because everything hasn't been happening, everyone as far as like the authorities, have tried to find alternative ways like you know school kids getting technology and being able to have Wi-Fi and some kind of accessibility so they can do their work.", "904": "Like when all of these cleared up, are they still going to have these resources aligned for kids who don't have as much or who haven't had these resources up until now. And basically fair treatment. Everyone being fairly treated based upon you know, how they can help one another not just you know a racial thing, but how can they really be brothers and sisters to one another if that makes sense.", "905": "That is such a great point. So I'm just looking at the time and it is 6:11 and my colleague Yuel [phonetic] just texted me and saying everyone is back in the main room. Ordinarily, we'd go around and each of you would have the opportunity to just share one thing you'd like to take away from this conversation and share back with the big group. So just be thinking about that, we're not going to get a chance to do that now but I would like to just thank you all for being a part of this and what I'm going to do now is stop the recording.", "906": "...Local Voices Network, so this is being handled by [corticals] Local Voices Network and the New York city department of health and mental hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. We have begun recording at this time and we got to share a little information with you before we begin the conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become a part of the Local Voices Network collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and builds our relationship with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices, the needs of the community, I'm going to [inaudible] Brownie, the need of the community to candidates, local policy makers and members of the media.", "907": "So this ends, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information. So this conversation is being recorded and transcribed, and it's going to be added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the projects at cortical discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to cortico the operator of Local Voices Netwwork to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "908": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please share only what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. We're going to ask each of you to say I agree, and just keep in mind that if you do say something, that you want to have redacted and that can be done after.", "909": "I agree.", "910": "I agree.", "911": "Okay.", "912": "I agree.", "913": "And for Kim? She said, I agree. And then for John, I'm going to copy and paste the agreement. So you can actually...", "914": "[inaudible].", "915": "[Ramona] can you hear me now?", "916": "Yes.", "917": "Good. I had to do through the phone it wasn't working on the computer.", "918": "Okay. No worries. I'm going to send you the agreement for the conversation, and then if you could just write that you agree to participate and we recorded. So just take a second to read through that and, we'll introduce you last, so you have time to read through it.", "919": "The text message, right?", "920": "Yup. Yeah.", "921": "All right. I'm reading through it now.", "922": "Okay. Sounds good. All right. So we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and to learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals. We have a few guidelines, for our conversation, you're going to speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. You're going to allow others to speak for themselves. You're going to share the time and allow others to finish speaking. And you're going to take turns. You're going to pause and if necessary, take time to reflect on the questions and we would like you to listen generously. So assume good intentions [inaudible] your words have an impact, when possible we're going to ask you to close unnecessarily programs, applications, and notifications, and keep your phone on silent. And like Juul mentioned, hit the mute button on your phone or your computer. So that we don't hear any background noise. So is everyone on board with these guidelines or is there anything that we would like to change?", "923": "Jasmine [crosstalk] on mute.", "924": "For those that can type [inaudible]. Okay. Brownie, I'm going to lock him up [inaudible] NYCHA is here because of our roof. So guys give me one minute and I'm going to put him away.", "925": "[inaudible], wait don't turn it off yet. [inaudible].", "926": "Yeah. Sorry. We have a leak in our roof and NYCHA has been dealing with it for seven years and they wanted to deal with it right now. So going back to our conversation, we're going to do the circle like Juul mentioned. So, when we ask questions and are having a discussion, we'll do, [Kia] Kim, Antonia, Sessa and then John, so that'll be the way we'll go around. And then we're going to move to our story for starters. So the next thing that we want to do is want to invite you to share a little bit about yourself since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today. I like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing look like and feel like to you next, think of a time, a place or a story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness.", "927": "What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel? So we're going to go around sharing and I'll start. So you guys, can get a sense of what the flow would be. So for me, I felt healthiest in my life when I was out in Hawaii going to grad school and I had a really affordable gym membership and I loved my gym and I went to the gym five times a week.", "928": "I was at the beach at least twice a week and I was tanned and my pain was under control. And I had a good team of doctors and I ate, locally grown food and I was a student. So I partied on the weekends and it was just a totally different experience from what I have now. So I think that would be, when I was the healthiest, in my opinion, or felt the best in my opinion. So then we're going to start with Kia. So again, we just want you to share when you felt you were healthiest in your life.", "929": "Hello everyone. Thanks for having me on the call. So my name is Kia. I'm from the [inaudible] houses in Brooklyn, but I'm also, actually right now working on a documentary film about, NYCHA, tenets and coping with the coronavirus impact. I don't know if you remember before, but I was telling you that I can't really participate in the conversation just because, I do have a contract with my school. So I have to remain objective, in certain situations. So I don't know how I should participate further, but I just want to make that clear to everyone. So it doesn't seem like I'm just sitting here, but yeah. I can't hear you anymore.", "930": "So share, I think you can share the responses and then we'll redact them.", "931": "Okay. When I felt my healthiest? I'm not even sure. I think, I guess I just feel my healthiest when I'm like on vacation. We had a family vacation to Martha's vineyard a couple of years back and, I guess just being away from home and being in a open space where there was clean air and just access to really good food. I think that was a time when I felt the healthiest.", "932": "We're going to move on to Kim. Do you see the unmute button, Kim? Let me see. Trying to unmute you. Is the unmute working on your end? It's a little hard on the phone. The screens are...", "933": "You have to tap the picture and then the new button is going to say unmute and mute. All you got to do is tap to picture your own picture.", "934": "Thank you, Antonio.", "935": "And it's at the bottom should say mute, video, share, and participants.", "936": "Let me see. Let's give Kim a minute. We'll come back to her, and unmute her somehow. Antonio, how about you go because you were after Kim.", "937": "Well, for me it was, maybe 10 years. Maybe, you know what? exactly 10 years ago. That's when I felt the healthiest. No, I mean personal reasons why, but it's been 10 years. Exactly. So that's pretty much where I'm at.", "938": "So 2010.", "939": "Yeah.", "940": "Okay. And, what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at that time? What actually contributed to you feeling healthy?", "941": "What contributed to it? I mean, I was a lot younger and a lot more active, I think, as you get older, depending what you do you're not as much active you taking a lot of chances are the things you eat, you eat sloppier and things like that. So I just think it was just, being young.", "942": "Okay. Sessa what about you, do you want to share with us when you felt healthiest in your life?", "943": "For me, I was cleaning a screw in upstate New York. So we had, a lot of wildlife. One of the places I was working was Cranberry Lake so, and there was a lot of wildlife and [lake] so it just for more ideas, it just felt healthier, more like [inaudible] and things like that.", "944": "Okay. And that was upstate, you said?", "945": "Yeah, that was in Cranberry Lake, near out of Romberg.", "946": "Oh, I've never heard of that. Sounds...", "947": "[inaudible] it's a biological station. That's owned by the college [inaudible].", "948": "It's next to all the prisons.", "949": "Oh, okay. Sounds pretty. And then we'll go to you, John. Can you share with us when you felt healthiest in your life?", "950": "Yes. Hello everyone. Can you hear me?", "951": "Yep.", "952": "Good. Because I can't get the video to work on his phone. This thing is driving me crazy anyway I felt healthiest in my life before I became diabetic. And one of the reasons why, because I was very, very active. I was active in all sports, constantly moving around, being involved, doing something, exercising and things of that nature. Once I became diabetic, I didn't feel as healthy.", "953": "Okay. So you had to change your activities, and that...", "954": "My activities, my diet, yes.", "955": "Okay. And then Kim, do you want to type, your response and I can read it for you or one thing that says I'd recommended, oh, you're unmuted.", "956": "Hello everyone.", "957": "Hi.", "958": "My name is Kimberly, I live in East Harlem, El Barrio. Been here 19 years. I'm a single parent and for the most part, I feel really healthy. The only thing that makes me unhealthy is my living conditions that I foresee as making me feel, not so healthy, but for the most part, I feel a 100% healthy.", "959": "Okay. And you just had a big birthday, right?", "960": "Yes, I did. I turned 53 years old on May 31st.", "961": "Yeah. She had a nice...", "962": "And I also got my, just got my long overdue bachelor's of science in psychology. So I feel really excited and really pumped and really healthy because that was long overdue.", "963": "Yeah. Kim's had a lot of good news for us the last month. So that's been helpful to keep people's spirits up. So now we're going to move onto the conversation about our hopes and our concerns, for the health and wellbeing of our community. So when we say community, we're going to think of NYCHA as a community, right? So you don't have to limit yourself just to the development that you're in. You can think about NYCHA where you live and the surrounding community as well. And then for the purposes of this conversation, we want you to think of community broadly. So share about either your neighborhood, community, or your social community. When you are responding to these questions. If you were speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you're speaking about when you share your story. And we've got a few questions to start us off.", "964": "So the first one would be is what in your community. So I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope this will be a time for some back and forth among you. As we share the stories, I invite you to respond to the points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. So what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, or [inaudible] that have positively contributed to your or your community health and wellbeing? I want you to share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. So does anyone want to pop up or should we go in a circle when you're thinking about what in your community, is supporting your health and wellbeing.", "965": "Personally, for me, I don't feel that there's really much being done in my community to support our health and wellbeing. I'm always complaining about the lack of green spaces. It upsets me that our local supermarket has horrible produce, that are fresh and good food is expensive, that we're surrounded by, a bunch of companies like FreshDirect and Amazon, and Amazon's coming in with another one and, there's all these trucks driving by. So, even though we live on the 17th floor, I constantly have to sweep and pick things up, and dust, keep our windows close. So for me, this was a hard question to come to terms with, because I don't really see how my community is being supported. So when I think of what we need for health, So Sessa I saw you nodding. Do you want to share a little bit?", "966": "Oh, sorry. I wasn't nodding at you. I was just approving what you were saying. I'm more like this is what's happening to us. I wasn't nodding at you. Sorry I apologize.", "967": "No not really like an agreement. Because you're [interesting].", "968": "[inaudible] and agree, right?", "969": "I can go if you want.", "970": "Yeah. So Antonio, how is it in your community?", "971": "In my community? It's nothing. I'm pretty much basically. I could say that most of what's going on, you pretty much have to do and do things on your own. And I'll explain that. You see how you just stated that when you go to your local supermarket, that the items there are, I don't know if you go through this, but they're very close to expiration dates on everything, you can buy bread right now. And in two days it's expiring or it, they change the stickers on stuff. And that only happens in communities of color. So we deal with that. It doesn't matter the name of the restaurant, as long as it's in an urban community, that's what you get into second hand stuff, stuff that is getting thrown away. So you have to really do some research if you want to get and be healthy, as far as food wise, there's nothing over here.", "972": "There's nothing encouraging. It's nothing, but really pretty much deli's offering, even the stuff in there, tuna, whatever it is has mountains of mayonnaise. It is nothing around. There's no people offer some, you get some of those places where like they're offering, hey, come see the dentist. That doesn't happen where I'm at. Nothing happens at all. Absolutely zero. And as far as that...", "973": "[inaudible].", "974": "What was that?", "975": "That's a really good point.", "976": "Yeah. Here's the thing. Look how I've been living for a while. I go and I only buy something when I'm going to eat that day. So yesterday I only went to the market to buy because I'm eating yesterday because it's been times I buy food and then I have to throw it out because it expires right away. You buy some chicken wings today. Saturday is ready to go. It's done. And it's like, that means it was sitting a lot longer than what it's actually being labeled. No one checks this stuff.", "977": "And then when you complain about it, the conditions of some of these markets, these supermarkets if you go really early in the morning, you'll see how very filthy they are. It's crazy. But that's just what you deal with. I mean, many grocery stores have cats in there. That's not very sanitary to have a cat inside the grocery store. These are grocery stores where they're making people sandwiches, bagels and all this stuff. If there's cats, there's rats. That's just my belief. So it's pretty much you got to do and worry about yourself. And that's very difficult even when it comes to health. So I'll get to that. My experiences with healthcare system alone, it took me maybe a full two years before I even got anyone to believe what was going on with me.", "978": "If you're a person of color and your insurance, that's all they care about. If you got Medicaid, these people don't care. You ain't going to get the help that you really need. It does not matter. That's just how it is. And I've experienced it for many, many years, many years. And it's sad. There's discrimination, there's racism, clinics, hospitals, all of that stuff. We're all labeled in some parts of sections of zip codes and areas. And it depends that's on the care you get, depending on where you live. It's sad that if I go to a hospital, I have to lie about my address because I personally know how you will be treated based upon the information you're giving.", "979": "Of course they tell you that it's for billing purposes. Yeah. Where do you live? We're just wanting to, no that it's not for that. It's not for that. It goes upon the type of care you're going to get. And that's why a lot of people, I mean, due to the COVID, they go to the hospital. They're not caring. They're like, look at this old person. Look at this person of color, looks the insurance they have trust me. They go through that and they won't get the same care as someone else who has private insurance and paying a lot of money. I can go on and on and on with that for a long time.", "980": "[inaudible] the next question that we had. Is relating to COVID. So what are you guys learning about your community's wellbeing and resilience in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? And Antonio just shared a little bit about, seeing how the treatment that we get in hospitals really depends on our insurance and on our race. Do any of you...", "981": "And [inaudible] and place of residence.", "982": "And your place of residence? Does anyone else have any comments regarding COVID? I think Sessa had a saying that he is going to add, go ahead Sessa.", "983": "We live in a food desert, so everything is designed away to make us healthy. We have more liquor stores here than Afro and the clinics we have chicken spot. We have pharmacists everywhere. That's to say that they know we have a high [inaudible] in diabetes. So we have become a commodity, to extract funds into a lack of hope. And the saddest part is, we don't have access to the waterfront and we don't have a lot of parks. And a lot of these community gardens are closed at times for the public. So we don't have a lot of open spaces. So here we're just trapped [inaudible] pollution.", "984": "Yeah. I saw [inaudible] regarding the gardens yesterday. So and I just said that due to, COVID, all NYCHA community gardens were to remain close, but community gardens being managed by outside groups. So in my Haven we have [barg] park and then we have Maria Sola, which is walking distance to me, those are open. So their members are getting to leave their homes, go to a place where they can socially distance and be in a green space. So even in that, right? It's like the infrastructure, when it comes specifically to NYCHA, everything that you guys are saying was worsened, by COVID even when it comes to having access to the little green spaces that we do have, anyone else have any comments on what they noticed during the pandemic?", "985": "In terms of what?", "986": "So it's really looking at, during the pandemic. What do you think it's important that folks understand regarding the effects that the pandemic had on those of us in public housing and our health and wellbeing?", "987": "I think that, from my perspective, I think that there was lack of PPE equipment for NYCHA residence. I think the cleaning of the grounds of NYCHA post-COVID, now COVID there's hardly any, the conditions within people's apartment, [po] COVID with how we're been deplorable and horrible. Now that we're in COVID, they're escalated to a worse than they were before. And my particular situation is getting worse. I started initially that my health was good, but my physical health is good, but it's destroying my emotional health and wellbeing and that of my children as well, because I'm supposed to be facilitating and overlooking them, joining their remote learning. And before, it was very cold in my apartment and there was no adequate heat and hot water and then there was leaks and mold and all kinds of different hazardous, deplorable conditions. And I don't understand.", "988": "But I do understand, but I don't understand what NYCHA's doing because now people and things what happened to George Floyd, everyone's talking about it, but this was happening to us 450 years ago. And it just makes me tired of being tired because I've had perfect health. And I wrote a little report here with another group that I'm affiliated, it's all relevant to what John said poverty. Poverty is at the root of this all and black and Latin communities as impacted by this the most, because we are dying at the most because we have these pre set conditions already. And then you just put COVID on top of that. It's just a disaster. And I'm looking for outlets to talk about it and keep on talking about it so we can mobilize the community or organize and get this to be changed because where we're decent human people will and we are worthy and we deserve to have better.", "989": "And for the food in the community, I noticed that my meat market Casa Blanca way, I love them dearly. There have not been open in a while. And then I have to go to the local supermarket and like, you all alluded to, there's nothing there. I had to pay $10 for a pack of four chicken wings that I would normally get 10 pounds of chicken wings for a set price. And I just don't understand. I just really don't get it. And it makes me annoyed and frustrated. And I'm glad I have this platform because it deteriorates when I keep it inside.", "990": "I'm glad you brought up emotional wellbeing because that is a topic that I think a lot of times in our community is overlooked. And, NYCHA is a pre-existing condition, right? Living in NYCHA sets you up already for so many, elements that, the way you explained, you already have all of this negative stuff happening because you live in NYCHA. And then on top of that came COVID and through all of that, you're supposed to maintain your emotional health, but we don't really have those resources because, in our community, Sessa was saying we have more liquor stores than hospitals. And it's just, there's one thing after another, that just gets compounded. Go ahead Sessa.", "991": "One thing is that it took months in order for NYCHA to be recognized, during this pandemic, they were overlooked for so long, the community board, to be honest they didn't start talking about this until probably a month ago, and we're not even there. So then we have a lot of high unemployment in NYCHA and they have nightmare that would pressure to start cleaning because of other work that you would do Ramona and all the things and other people that were doing and Jasmine. And they were pressuring for them to do that. And then they still haven't done a good job.", "992": "And then the [inaudible] comes in almost a month ago to start having more clinic testing sites in our neighborhood in the South Bronx was overlooked for over two, three months. We came at the end, we faced, the Latinos and African American we live here and we face a similar injustice or [inaudible] all this barriers that we face and they want us to make more money. Then you have all these barriers on that wave. But it's just crazy. The final thing I would say, is I just can't believe that we have little flyers. I said nothing about what's happening COVID and then, because it's hard here, it's a lot of people, a lot of cases. And then something without knowing their families that died. So I just don't get it. I used to live in a third world country, and [inaudible] like NYCHA is a third world country [inaudible].", "993": "[inaudible]. So Kia had raised her hand and then Antonio.", "994": "Yeah. So I want to say that I, agree with like everything that has been said this far, and I guess I'll just share, the experience from my neighborhood. So I live in Brownsville in Brooklyn, I think that's among, I mean, one of the poorest or poverty ridden districts, and we face a lot of issues with like trash and, when we're speaking about COVID, I mean, Kim was saying pre-COVID we had issues with trash, but post-COVID, there's like trash on the streets. And literally I was telling Ramona this the other day, like I see homeless people sleep on the street in my neighborhood. This is something that I regularly see. And so then we have people who are also then throwing mask and gloves on the ground as well.", "995": "So no one's picking those up. And then, it's just like, the hallways are still dirty. I'm still smelling urine. When I walk out of my door, I'm still seeing people are not putting things in incinerator. So it's definitely very frustrating. And it does weigh on your emotional health, like Kim was saying, because you're like, why does no one care about like, what's going on over here? And it's like you pay rent we're members of society. They're like, my mom is an essential worker, people at NYCHA are important and we do important jobs and we do important work. And I feel sometimes it's overlooked. And, as to the point everyone was saying about the food. I can definitely attest to that because I do not go shopping in my neighborhood for food.", "996": "I actually go to downtown Brooklyn and I go to trader Joe to get food. And it's crazy that I have to take a Uber to go somewhere that's 20 or 30 minutes from where I live to get fresh food. It's annoying. And to the point that, you guys were also saying about the liquor stores, we had a huge laundromat and they cut the laundromat in half to make a liquor store. And literally just put a taco bell. They're erecting a taco bell up a few blocks from where I live right now. And we already have a, Popeye's little Caesars Domino's, McDonald's KFC, Checkers. We have these in walking distance and like the chicken place and Chinese restaurant on every corner and, yeah, it's cool when you want to get a little snack or something, but there's one store in my neighborhood that makes salads that I'll go to sometimes to get a salad.", "997": "But besides that, it's just like fast food all the time. And I also have like a neighbor who throws stuff out of her window food every day. We've complained about it. She wanted to fight my mother for complaining about it. And so I'm waking up to food falling out of the window or someone pouring stuff out their window. So it's very disheartening sometimes. And sometimes I think, Ramona and I would talk about this sometimes hard to separate yourself from this is like where I live, but this is not who I am. I'm not defined by, the place that I live in. But I agree with everything that was said, Kim said, the root of it is poverty. And they're erecting more apartment buildings in my neighborhood as we speak, so there's nowhere to walk. It's just like apartment buildings. That's what I see out my window. And so, yeah.", "998": "Yeah. That's a good point. Especially the salad, the accessibility of salads in our community. If you want to go out and get something healthy, Antonia, you had something else you wanted to drop in?", "999": "I wanted to add that. I think most of us who live in the housing complexes, we face more discrimination than anything. You can call the cops on your neighbor. Who's freaking doing whatever they not supposed to be doing and make a complaint. The police will come and be like, it's in their mind already that people who are in housing, you're considered nothing to these people. Anything, I've talked to you about, people I've complained to the Barrel president, stuff like that. These people don't move for nothing. Once you give your address and they see that you're a part of housing, it's almost to the point that you're nothing, that's it, it's like, Ooh, well. And that's the bigger thing. How we're discriminated against things will not get done. And then as far as someone mentioning that the cleanliness look what's going on here.", "1000": "I mean, another thing is they're hiring people with lazy attitudes and mentalities [inaudible] describing, she mentioned her neighbor who throws stuff out the garbage out the window and stuff. Imagine having her employed to clean the building, these are the type of people. And then what they do, if you walk around, you'll see, they're just sitting around. They don't care. Even if they live in the buildings or the complexes, they don't care. They'll just leave it. All you may see is temporary cleanup of the first floor of the lobby of every building. And after that, that's it.", "1001": "Facts.", "1002": "Because anyone who's doing the inspection is only going to peek in because in their mind, they're like, man, I'm getting out of here. I'm doing my eighth. And I'm getting out of this place. And that's how it is. You go to management and management acts like, they're your boss. You go there, hey [inaudible] have this. They start screaming at you. Well, you know what? This is this. And it's like a prison I've been in prison in the past, looking at the Gates around us. They have those inmates, inmates. This is how prison looks, where all these Gates around. And this is how...", "1003": "MAde them take it down.", "1004": "Medium classified prisons are gates just like this, everywhere.", "1005": "It's funny. I started actually had just typed gait mentality in the comments. But it's like even the small green spaces that we would have access to.", "1006": "It has gates. That's why, when you told me the other day about the garden, it has Gates. All they need to do is add bob wire and it'll be a person. It seems like, they can put people there. If they want it to, what is their purpose of this? I've gone to management to ask, what are you guys doing? I don't know. We don't know what's going on. Then I got another one stating, oh, they put the gates around the grass because they're going to be digging up the grounds and fixing pipes, they ain't doing that. When are they doing that? 10 years from now? No something is up and it doesn't matter. They don't care about us if you live here. They don't care about you. It's just what it is. It's not going to change either. That's just my outlook on it. And it's just sad, it's really sad.", "1007": "I think now would be a good time to share, a snippet from a conversation that was held before this one. And we just want to make believe that this person is participating with us. And Juul's going to play it for us. And I want you to, take the time to really process, what he says. And if anything comes to mind as he's speaking, pull that to the end. So then you can give us some feedback. So [Juul] can you play the snippet?", "1008": "Yep. I got you. Give me one second.", "1009": "I can't hear anything.", "1010": "Juul the volumes not working.", "1011": "Sorry about that. Okay. And, for more context, before I replay it, in [Modern] Hunts point and his mom's a nurse. And so this is a story of, just how he feels about the situation.", "1012": "Well, it's not specifically that she's been sharing with me. She, talks to her friends, on the phone and I overhear it. She talks about how she has to share a gown with her coworkers. She talks about how she needs to reuse a mask. She talks about that she has to work with five patients a day. So that means that she's really [inaudible] she's being exposed to a lot of people with the virus. And that scares me because not only is she my family, but she has a high chance of getting that virus because she's overexposed to it. And she has to share a gown, that makes no sense. Yeah. I don't know how to explain this. If she catches this virus and something happened, I don't know if he was wanting mild, moderate or, severe. I just don't want it to happen. Yeah, that's all I have to say.", "1013": "[inaudible], from Hunt's point, you guys heard was talking about his mom and her being a nurse during COVID? I know Kia mentioned how a lot of people in public housing are first responders, right? And were considered essential workers. But having heard this, does anyone want to share anything that came to mind as you listened to this? Or any reactions that you have to it?", "1014": "I went to the emergency room during the middle of the pandemic or whatever they call it COVID and when I got to the ER, I didn't get a mask, I didn't get none. I was just thrown right into the, where the little rooms, whereas everyone else and the crazy part is this the person who was taking blood pressure, doing EKG, whatever it is they were doing, they had no gloves. They had no mask. And then when I asked the lady said, \"Well, if we got to use different gloves and different this on every patient, we're going to run out. We don't have many.\" So I started to think if there's 100 people here and you're not changing, none of them had gloves and masks, none of maybe two. And they were just sitting at computers, doing nothing.", "1015": "So, after that, I had to get tested after I left from there. But still imagine if this is all wild, I don't know what to say. I think I'm agreeing with whoever was on that audio. You really can't come up with any words to describe the madness that goes on. And it's like, that's some serious stuff. You got to live with someone who works with. And most of us don't have enough space to quarantine. Especially if you live in housing, you don't got big spaces. It's either someone sleeps in the living room, but you ain't got two bathrooms. You got to share the same bed. It's beyond crazy. And then the effects of that, the mental part of it, forget physical first. It's the mental part. It's just breaks you down. You don't know what the hell to do. That's my look on that. It's sad. It's everything you can think of.", "1016": "What the person said is complicated. So difficult to think about the good. This a national thing, I mean, the way the federal government went about this create a lot of these problems. I remember in March, a friend of mine that worked in Mount Sinai who said, we in trouble, we don't have enough ventilators. He was saying that before all these things happened, being there in the hospital and having the sense of pessimism for people that work in the hospital, they already had a sense of pessimism that there is not enough ventilators. And how are you going to get the gloves? How are you going to get the, mask? And he was afraid, and then not being supported by the federal government and then the state squabbling with each other, with the city. I do not get it as one of the richest country in the world. We are so far behind and you tell, how we deal with pandemics and health. So this is a very complicated thing that the person was talking about.", "1017": "And Kia she shared a link in the chat. So I'll text it to Antonio and John, if you guys can't see it, and then you also wanted to share some feedback.", "1018": "Yeah. So, I sent a link in the chat. What happened? Oh okay. I was saying, I sent a link in the chat, so my mother, she is an essential worker. She's been working through the pandemic and, she's a food service worker in the elementary school, which is not a job that we would think would be essential before this. But it actually is because a lot of children, depend on school lunches because they don't have anything else to eat, but they also extended it to them feeding the homeless and adults as well. And I remember, and if you click the link, whenever you have a chance, I did a short video and some pictures. I remember she was literally cutting stockings to use on her face because they weren't giving them any masks, they weren't giving them any gloves. She was still expected to come into work.", "1019": "And they told them that, if they went to go get tested and they didn't have a note, they weren't going to get paid. So, yeah, it took a long time for them to even give her anything. And it was like those little pharmacy masks that you have to throw away, after wearing them. So, early on in the pandemic, she, and I didn't really know what the signs were, because that wasn't clear either we were getting mixed information about that. So we would be in here with mask on, and it's hard because it's like, I came to hug my own mom. We couldn't be in the same room with each other because she was going out every day and, she's still going out and they possibly want them to work through the summer as well.", "1020": "So it's no breaks and they're not equipped properly. It's like people expect you to just keep going. But it's like, was just mentioned, if you live in an apartment, how are you really socially distancing? I guess we have two bedrooms, but it's like, I don't always want to be just stuck in my bedroom or I want to be able to sit in the same room with my mom or hug her and stuff because, you have built emotional connections with your family members. So it's hard. And it was something that was handled very poorly. And as Sessa said, in a country like this, I don't even understand how we're so, not advanced and medically behind, but yeah, so it's [plain] out in everyday life and I really have a lot of respect for the essential workers who are going out there and risking their lives.", "1021": "Yeah. You guys have made some really good points from Bodega cat. It's interesting because Bodega cat, I think in our communities has become a minor celebrity. People make cartoons, about Bodega cat, people honor Bodega cats. And then, I have always been terrified of cats, so I don't go near them, but Antonio gave us such a good point? The reason that the Bodega cat exists is because you have mice and rats and then the Bodega's guys tend to be our closest, food availability, for many of us. So it blew my mind. I keep thinking about these cats. I'm like, oh my God, this is a problem. So we are running down my clock. So we've got like a couple of questions left. John, maybe you can take this one, given the conversation that we had today, what would a New York city where everyone can be healthy look like? And what would it feel like to you?", "1022": "The first thing for New York city to be healthy is for adequate healthy food to be available for everyone, regardless of where you live and for it to be affordable, that is the key you can go shopping, like the young lady says she goes to another supermarket outside of her neighborhood. She has to take a Uber, but is it always affordable to the people that live in public housing? Most of the time it's not, most people in public housing on, well, not most, but there are people in housing that's on a fixed income. So if you're on a fixed income, you have to budget that money correctly for that whole entire week based on your family or based on the month. Sometimes it's even based on day to day which is even harder. That's a true hardship. So a healthy New York city would look like stores in our neighborhoods, across the city that have healthy produce fruits and vegetables at an affordable price.", "1023": "First and foremost, that has to be done. We go to these Bodega guys, everybody's saying about the Bodega and the cat, there's a cat in the store. I don't shop in the store. I wouldn't buy a bottle of water from the store, bag of potato chips from the store. If there's a cat in the store, that's very unsanitary. You have food in there. You might go into a Bodega that sells sandwiches. They have hot food and they say cat in the store. That is disgusting. I am not doing it. So a healthy New York to me would be healthy food being available across the board for everyone, regardless of where you live, regardless of your zip code and to have access to that early access. Not that we would have to leave our community or leave our neighborhood to go to another supermarket. We have these food deserts all over the place to be able to get some healthy food.", "1024": "And then if you don't have a vehicle, now you got to pay twice, creates another hardship. If you don't have a friend with the vehicle, that's doing the same thing that you're doing, and you can piggyback off of that and take a ride with them, then what are you going to do? So it was very, very hard. Most people are used to going to the local Bodega get a sandwich in the morning and get breakfast in the morning or whatever it is that they sell in that particular Bodega. And they're satisfied and comfortable with that. And then you look at the asthma rates. You look at the obesity rates with all that's going on in the community.", "1025": "Like you were saying, Ramona, with all of the trucks that's driving you on the 17th floor, you got to dust and sweep constantly is coming that high up, which you're very close to it. You're closer to it [inaudible] your houses than we are in my even houses. And that's really scary that that's happening on the 17th floor, where you live, that you have to dust and sweep practically every day because of the traffic that's going by. These bad conditions. As far as living is terrible, diabetes, obesity, lack of healthy foods. And that was the second part of the question that you asked me too, what was that?", "1026": "What would be a healthy New York feel like?", "1027": "A healthy, New York would feel like such a blessing that you can go anywhere and you can afford to buy whatever it is that you really want. That's healthy for you. Oh man that would be such a good feeling, euphoria. Definitely.", "1028": "Okay. Thank you, John. And [Sessa] have had a comment also?", "1029": "[inaudible] so, it's infrastructure talking about all this has to do with infrastructure. We need indoor, better quality, [inaudible] saying, indoor quality, healthy things to be done indoors, outdoors as well. So look at this pandemic, what it has shown it has reduced the air pollution dramatically within the city and other cities around the world. That just shows you the things that should be done in order to [inaudible]. I talk about systems all the time. We can't do this linearly. It's a system that they have to, focus on, we have transportation, we have housing, all of this are coming together. And then I have to say about this, but they'll come up with them. Like I said, it has shown that we have less people using cars.", "1030": "You have more public transportation, more walking. It reduces air pollution, which we reduce [inaudible] and we have more open spaces when you have healthy food options, easily reduces diabetes, how [are] these things that they're all interconnected. So I've never looked at this meaningly. I always try to see the whole picture and it has to do with infrastructure. Now, I say we focused on the infrastructure, gaining more neutral. You're always going to have this problem. We live in the island of pollution, which is crazy. We live in the cross Bronx expressway and [inaudible]. This is called an Island of pollution. We're trapped in it, so now to deal with total infrastructure, these things are always going to happen and it starts with the [inaudible].", "1031": "So it sounds from what we've said, there's one part, which is the infrastructure of the city doesn't really lend itself to creating healthy communities because the way that we've developed, it seems we are not prioritizing the right things. And we're allowing a lot of businesses that don't lend to our health, to thrive in our community. So when Kia was talking about the stores that are in her community and how far she has to go to, a reliable source of healthy food, I was thinking of what neighborhoods used to be before, where you had your meat market, you had your fruit market, you had the guy that did your fish.", "1032": "And each of those people took such pride in selling you quality affordable goods because the community [inaudible] to them, and then now we have these larger supermarkets and they're not upholding almost that agreement that we should have with the people that we shop from. But you guys really made some, at least I think that you made some really powerful points today. I'm so proud. So now we're almost getting ready to wrap up. So the last question that I have is I want to invite each of you to share. What's one thing that you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you would want other people to hear and we'll start with, Kim and then we'll go around in a circle. So what's the one thing that you heard today that you're going to be taking away from this conversation and that you'd like other people to hear?", "1033": "I don't know. I don't have any thoughts on that right at the moment I learned a lot, I see that we all have a lot of commonalities. I see that we're all interested in our communities and that's what I'm going to take away.", "1034": "Okay. So we all share a passion for our community. Okay, what about you Kia?", "1035": "I mean, I guess, something to take away is that although, we all live in NYCHA, different neighborhoods are in need of different things. And so, when we talk about NYCHA sometimes we group everything together, but we need to see the needs of specific, in the Bronx, the needs are different in NYCHA than it would be here in Brownsville and, so forth with East Harlem. So I think that's really important to recognize we're all together, but also recognize that each community needs different, specific things. And I guess what I like other people to hear is just, to hear, about the situations with the cleanliness and to be cognizant that while some places are getting special services or cleaned to handle, living in these conditions are not new to NYCHA residents and they're only made worse by things like pandemics. And so, that should be a main priority for just understanding what's going on. That cleanliness is a top is [inaudible] [priority].", "1036": "What about you? Sessa", "1037": "What I get from this is, we live in different neighborhoods [though] you face the same thing, and also see that we are using [inaudible] together, or this wouldn't have been possible. So I think that's a sense of hope. We're talking to each other we have [similar] similarities. And then we'll see what happens next, what we can do with it and other people to listen to this as well, that in the South Bronx has always seen the place that people will do anything but, that's not true. [inaudible] some of the things we have done for so many years but that's not [inaudible].", "1038": "And what about you, John?", "1039": "For me, I was amazed at the audio that was played when the lady that works in our hospital said they have to share gowns that was just dumbfounded to me. That was flabbergasting. I could not believe that hospital workers have to share a gown working on people with COVID. That is utterly amazing. And what I really appreciate about this is that the commonalities, the young lady said that everybody has, and we're sharing them and we can building points from here as far as what to do and how to go about it and how true change and difference in our communities. And I want to thank you for that Ramona.", "1040": "Well, thank you. So, the one thing that I heard today that way is what Sessa said, which is a lot of the issues that we discussed for NYCHA are really a result of people, dehumanizing people that live inside public housing, and folks think that we deserve to live like this, or we're not worthy of better things. And that's been the story that's been told about public housing, [systemically] right? So Sessa was talking about the importance of the system and that's been said about public housing since the 1970s and 1980s, when predominantly black and Latinos moved into public housing. I think it's really important for those of us in public housing to prove that's not true to make sure that many people as possible it gets to hear, which is why I wanted you guys to be a part of this conversation. That's all the questions that we have for you, today. So do any of you have any closing thoughts that you'd like to share or a general reflection on the conversation or any questions that you have for us before we finish?", "1041": "Yes. I would like to add something. I know it was briefly stated about mental health. Mental health is so important during this pandemic. If you don't have the regular comradery, you can't go outside, you can't talk to people, you can't do the things that you used to do, you're basically isolated. That is not a healthy situation. That is not a healthy recipe. You have to fight it. You have to do what you need to do in order to talk to people in order to engage and be engaged. And that's the only way that we are going to get through this, the mental health, in some cases, is worse than the virus itself because everybody can suffer from the mental health, not everybody's going to obtain the virus. So please do whatever you can call people that you haven't spoken to in a while, send them text messages, correspond with people. The mental health aspect is extremely, extremely important.", "1042": "And I would piggy back on that. And I know John and I have talked, last year there was a suicide here at Mitchell where a young man that was overdue on child support, and had lost his license, decided to take his life. And it was such a traumatic experience because it was 11 o'clock in the morning. And there were people then outside, it was a spring day. And everyone saw that. And I remember after talking to John and saying, things like this happen in our community, things like suicide, things like shootings, things like police brutality, happened last Thursday here, things like COVID and we never get PTSD assistance. People never come into our neighborhoods and say, because you just went through this traumatic experience, we're going to be available to you. And when you look at other neighborhoods and other cities, right? When they have a shooting, no school gets shut down and it's filled with counselors.", "1043": "And to piggyback on that, it's also, because I suffer with post traumatic stress disorder and I get mental health services for it. But then you also have to be mindful that what you tell them, what you disclose to them, because if you are a parent and you disclose something to them, you also can have your children taken away. And I have experienced that. So you have to be careful. You put in an awkward position and I call it, you damn, if you do your damn, if you don't, because if you disclose that you need help, that help can later be used against you. So it's really tricky because I identified that I needed to have help because I had five special needs children. And I was a single parent and I got overwhelmed. And guess what they did, they brought me up on charges of neglect, which was not fair.", "1044": "It was simply me asking for help. So if you're black and you are poor, and like John said, you live in a poor community and you got Medicaid and you got all of these other government to assistance. You have to be mindful and you have to be careful. I got my children back, but it wasn't the point. They shouldn't have took them in the first place because I identified I needed help, but they went somewhere else with it. They said that I was mentally challenged. They took it to an extreme level. So us as minorities and people of color and people of Latin X, we can't really ask for help because then we're penalized for asking for help when we know that we need help, because predominantly of the service providers, that's providing a service is the ones that we need don't need to get help from them because they don't really understand because they never even experienced that going back to what John said in a zip code.", "1045": "And I don't even know what it's like to be eating a can [inaudible] beans, so that I can get my diploma. So you still got to be mindful. I just threw that out there. You just got to be really mindful.", "1046": "[inaudible] because there's a lot of studies that show that, when people of color ask for mental health assistance, especially mothers they're seen as being...", "1047": "Weak.", "1048": "Incapable of being a parent yet in the white community. So all their friends, oh, I have my extending appointment every Tuesday with doctor. And they all sit around and talk about it, right? And no one challenges, a white mom that says, \"I need to smoke weed to be able to cope with my kids.\" But if a black mom or a Latina mom were to say that there's that judgment that's being passed, right? And you also are hinting there at the lack of service providers that understand our experiences. It's the same thing with our teachers, right? If your teacher doesn't [inaudible] that sometimes in your house [inaudible] they don't get it the difficulty of you staying from [inaudible] because they've never gone through hunger, because they've never gone through hardships, they don't see that as like a whole picture for [inaudible] mental health. And then Sessa have you got another comment?", "1049": "A couple of things, I would say in Syracuse when I was going to school and then it's sense of having a low income neighborhood, in dollars or in grades range. I have seen, low income white populations that work with this as well. It's very complicated, I have seen, one of the biggest problems we have in my neighborhood. And I think a couple of them, is medical costs for mental health, this is crazy, for medicine that somebody has to take is $1000 per month. If you take that medicine, in order to deal with the condition and the services are horrible. I mean, we've been in situations, they go to the places they automatically told they're crazy.", "1050": "And they put it in an institution or asylum or Lincoln hospital. When they're covered times somebody was acting up with depression, things like that. They put them in a room there for days and they just lack of respect, lack of sympathy, [towards] mental health. And then a lot of people don't want to talk about mental health. And that doesn't scream, every human being deal with this, some form of depression in my society and different this, a spectrum of it.", "1051": "I have seen it, I have seen it with family members, have seen it personally for me as well. It does. When you go, funny thing I will say when you go to a job and you find out that might be where starting in depression, you might not even get that job. They give it to somebody else and say, oh, I don't want to pay half high health insurance. They go, this person is dealing with [inaudible] mental health you get discriminated for dealing with those things. And especially with Latinos, we put extra barriers. I mean, for Latinos for me because I'm latino I'm not saying, just say me. I don't understand does it just gets me stressed out and stuff like that because many jobs have been lost [inaudible]. They automatically say, they're crazy. They can't do the job. They're not given opportunities. And that affects our neighborhood because many people here deal with mental issues. That's one of the reasons why we have high unemployment rates [crosstalk].", "1052": "Necessary to overcome them. Yeah. Well, thank you. So that wraps up our conversation. So just a reminder, what will happen with the thoughts that you share today? These recordings will be transcribed, indexed and eventually shared with journalists, public officials and participants in the Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, the New York city health department. We encourage you to share the word about the Local Voices Network. And if you want to convene another group of friends like this, you can let us know by going to lvn.org. So localvoicesnetwork.org. Thank you so much for joining us and for sharing your thoughts. And, Juul's going to stop the recording and...", "1053": "Cool. Okay, so welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in collaboration with the New York City Trans Oral History Project. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this conversation. My name is Aviva Silverman, and I'll be facilitating this with my colleague, AJ Lewis.", "1054": "That's me. Hello.", "1055": "We are collective members of the New York City Trans Oral History Project, and the two of us will be trading off as facilitators, and we're really honored for the opportunity to hear about your experiences and perspectives. We're recording now, and at the end of the convo the audio will be saved and the video will be discarded. The audio will be part of the LVN collection and eventually part of our collection also.", "1056": "And so, some of the purposes of this conversation are that first, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each others' lives. The second is we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And the third is that we want to create a unique listening channel, through which we will lift the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers, and members of the media.", "1057": "The Local Voices Network wants to foster sharing our stories for our lived experience rather than speaking about our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with health and well-being of your community rather than sharing any personal health information, although you are invited to share personal health information if you want.", "1058": "Okay, so here's the consent part. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available for journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the public.", "1059": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation, and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or a website, or broadcast or a local radio station.", "1060": "Or appear elsewhere including other forms of media. So, please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, say, \"I agree.\" And we'll wait, and everyone will just go around and say, \"I agree.\"", "1061": "I'll start. I'm AJ, and I agree.", "1062": "I'm Aviva, and I agree.", "1063": "Josh. And I agree.", "1064": "I'm Charlie, and I agree.", "1065": "I'm Ethan, and I agree.", "1066": "Kim, are you able to unmute yourself?", "1067": "Oh, okay. I'm Kim, and I agree. I'm sorry.", "1068": "Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. So, we want to make sure that everyone has a chance to share and learn from each other in this conversation, and we want to encourage you to respond to each other and not just us, which is what AJ mentioned before. But we also understand that there could be crosstalk because we're on Zoom, so we'll just be patient with that. And we want to remind everyone that silence is a good thing.", "1069": "Sometimes it takes a lot of space to think about things, and we encourage that. And it's totally fine if you want to come back to a question later. And we also want to state that every question is optional. You definitely don't have to answer everything, so it's up to you if you want to jump in or not. If this sounds okay to everyone we'd like to just pause for a second and take a group breath, and then we'll get into the questions.", "1070": "MI do want us to take a group breath, may I ask if anyone would like to suggest any additional guidelines for proceeding with the group conversation? Perfect. Aviva, I'll allow you to lead us in our breath.", "1071": "Okay. Now, we can take a group breath. Great.", "1072": "Great. Thank you all again. So, to begin we're going to do a kind of quick round of introductions. We'll have a sort of icebreaker kind of question in a moment, and then we'll move into the kind of main portion of the interview conversation. For this first part, we're just going to go around in a circle format to make things easier, just to minimize tech confusion I'm just going to paste our names into the chat in the order that we'll go in. Let's see if this works.", "1073": "Yeah. It's simply everybody's first names in alphabetical order. Can everybody see it okay? Okay, perfect, thank you. To get us started with intros, I'd ask if everyone would mind just sharing just your first name or pseudonym if you prefer.", "1074": "In addition, I'd like to invite everyone to share just a basic bit of background about who you are, what your work is. We'll go into much more depth about that in the conversation itself. And any other basic sort of biographical things you'd like listeners to know about you.", "1075": "Lastly, I'd like to invite you, if you'd like, to share a kind of key personal value of yours that really guides the work that you do. I'm going to have Aviva and I we're all just going to introduce ourselves. I'll go first. So, I'm AJ I go by he/him/his pronouns. I identify as a White trans guy. I am an oral historian and collective member of the New York City Trans Oral History Project.", "1076": "I'm also an educator. I teach mainly on social justice and social movements, and a value that I bring to really all of that work and including this conversation is simply the value of listening. I think that it is so crucial for social movements and social change to really make time and take space to simply listen and learn from each other.", "1077": "And make sure that conversations are happening even in times of crisis when things are happening so fast, and also capitalism wants us to speed up. I value listening as a social justice practice, and that's one of the reasons why I'm excited to be here. [crosstalk]", "1078": "Hi. I'm Aviva, and I am currently in New Jersey, although I live in Chinatown. I use they/them pronouns, and I am an artist Primarily. I work in sculpture and performance, and I also am really excited to be a part of the collective of Trans Oral History and thinking about oral history as world-building and a way to contribute to an archive that is so necessary. I think a value within that is interdependence and how we are relationally connected to each another, and how in supporting and caring for one another we nourish everyone.", "1079": "Charlie, I'd like to invite you to kick us off next.", "1080": "Thanks. Hi. Sorry I'm just trying to unmute. Can you hear me okay?", "1081": "Yeah, it's great. We're all going to be fussing with technology throughout this. Don't stress yet.", "1082": "No problem. So, my name is Charlie, and I use they/them pronouns. I am a full spectrum Doula, a certified breast and chest feeding counselor and a chef, and I'm based in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. I identify as a Black non-binary trans person [inaudible] experience Afro-Caribbean.", "1083": "And a value of mine that is guiding my work right now is the ability to receive, to create more mutual relationships in our work. We're all very good at giving, and so right now I'm really [inaudible] receiving care from others and doing so in a way that continues the cycle of reciprocity in community.", "1084": "Hey everybody, my name is Ethan. I use he/him or they/them pronouns. I am a volunteer chaplain at Rikers Island. Sort of have been put on hold due to the pandemic obviously, but... So my work looks a little bit differently now. It's a lot more telehealth and sort of organizing to get folks released, which is really exciting, and not something that we've always been able to do in the capacity that we are now even though it's for unfortunate reasons.", "1085": "A value that I am sort of trying to hold through everything that has been going on, I think is that I guess sort of one or two things that... The notion that the revolution needs to be intersectional. And I think one of the questions we'll get to has to do with how the Black Lives Matter Movement that's happening in this current time and the pandemic impact each other.", "1086": "And for me it just so revealing of the flawed system we're living in and the ways in which we're not intersectional in our day to day lives and structure of society. And so as we're in this really unpredictable and sort of scary time, I am both trying to focus on another world that is possible while also like trying to figure out how to make it accessible for everybody.", "1087": "Thank you, Ethan and Charlie and my hosts. My name is Josh and I am currently a social worker at Mount Sinai Hospital. I work in primary care, and I work with patients who have complex bio-psychosocial needs. In the past I've worked with queer and trans youth. I've worked in a medical setting with trans folks. I've done therapy for HIV positive folks.", "1088": "I've done immigration work with queer and trans people. And my pronouns are he/him/they/them. I identify as queer myself. Arab American, first gen. And a value that I want to integrate, or that is guiding my work right now. That's a great question.", "1089": "I think that I'm just going to riff off the other folks in this chat and just kind of move forward on the idea of interdependency and collective action and just collective-ism and how we actually can resolve our own issues, and we're safer outside of the system. So yeah, I think that that would maybe just be the guiding force and hopefully I would love to be in a position someday where my job would be useless and nonexistent.", "1090": "Do I go next?", "1091": "Yes please.", "1092": "All right. Good evening everyone. Again, my name is Kim. I am the Vice President and executive Director Seek Your Life Community Kinship Life where I do a lot of work for transgender and gender nonconforming individuals from the perspective of medical and clinical mental health. I am an author, I'm a mother of two.", "1093": "I recently divorced after 11 and a half years. I actually reside in New York City, but I'm originally from Barbados. And one of the deep personal values of mine and I got really caught up where this pandemic is concerned, I heard the word essential worker. I never view myself as an essential work. I just continue working not only from home, but on site also.", "1094": "And there's a regular job that I go to. So I go to this pantry and I make sure more than 150 people get feed, whether it's homeless or low income individuals from the Black and Brown community and I encourage a lot of transgender and gender nonconforming individuals to come and get groceries and food because no one should be left home hungry if that's what they want.", "1095": "So one of my values is to continue connecting, not only with the organization I own, I oversee where surgeries and enhancement and all that is concerned, however, I remove myself from that. We're into humanity and making sure that people are being fed and their bills are being paid and those kinds of things. So that's my deep value to continue as I progress. And I'm grateful. Thank you.", "1096": "Thank you so much, everybody. And again we're delighted to have all of you guys donating your time and knowledge tonight. I'm really glad to have us all here. Before we move into our main sort of discussion, I think I'd also like to do a kind of brief little storytelling exercise maintaining the same circle format, although of Aviva and I are going to try to take up less space and step back from this one, although you're welcome to call us out if you want to know more about our lives at any point.", "1097": "And so when I... What I'm going to propose is we're in this moment of really profound crisis in a lot of different ways around issues of health and wellbeing. And we were hoping that everyone might go around and simply share a story about a recent experience of yours that's impacted your understandings and experiences of health and wellbeing.", "1098": "This is open-ended, you can choose any story you'd like to tell. Charlie, I would invite you to go first. Again, every question is optional, so you can opt out of everything, but Charlie, I would invite you to go first if you'd like.", "1099": "Thank you. Yeah, I actually... This question is really resonating in my life right now because I recently got hurt. Last Wednesday I went to a street protest and was tackled and beaten by the cops, and one of them broke my arm while I was being arrested.", "1100": "So for the last week I've actually been sort of on a loopy [inaudible] cloud while I'm trying to manage the pain and the trauma and just coming back into my body. And I am realizing how surrounded I am by community and by people who I consider my family who have just been showing up for me every day and coordinating care around me in a way that is very similar to what I do for families when I [inaudible] new families through their transition into parenthood and bringing a newborn into their lives.", "1101": "It's really looking at whether it is a direct and immediate need to those very tangible needs first. And then just looking all around them and noticing what else is it that they could need in their life by just being able to sort of protect someone with a net of safety and love around someone and protection around someone. And to do that, it takes so many people. It takes so much community.", "1102": "And so I'm really applying that to my work right now and re-envisioning the way that I show up for families and also help them organize their own community around them. Because I think we are really out of practice of that in this capitalistic society where we're so individualistic [inaudible] to ask people for help to lean into those kinds of support that we have. Yeah. I feel like I've kind of answered the question.", "1103": "Thank you. Ethan would you like to go next?", "1104": "Yeah. So I'm thinking, and it's so interesting because generally I have a million horror stories in regards to medical things, but I'm actually thinking of a positive one. The most recent sort of medical experience I've had. It was from a patient I encountered in the ward and my doctor is Zil Goldstein, who's like somewhat of a well known doctor. So yeah. I feel like a lot of queer folks know who she is.", "1105": "But she's just really... She's made sure to follow up with me. She's the doctor for both me and my partner. So they have made sure to call and follow up with us and I had my followup via telehealth, and it was cool, it was new, it was unique. I have a lot of feelings about the telehealth, because as someone who has a physical disability, I live with fibro and I have a compromised immune system.", "1106": "I think it's really awesome to not have to trek all over the world to go to the doctors, especially if you don't need lab work. But obviously when you need the lab work you just have to go. But yeah, so I just thought that was a really positive experience and I also just felt really cared for, which is just honestly not something that I have experienced with medical professionals as a trans person, as a disabled person, as someone who is fat, as someone who is just queer, just all of it.", "1107": "Yeah, so that was just a really positive experience for me. And there was something about the fact that of course my trans doctor showed up for me. It felt like an extension of my community showing up for me in a way that my doctor didn't show up for me like another trans person did. And that's also just how I feel Zil approaches her work, which is why I love her so much, but...", "1108": "So that was just a really great experience and it was actually really impactful because my family and I are we're in student housing, so we're having to move and keeping her as our doctor was a key influencing factor and where we were moving, because this has been the first comprehensive doctor I think I've ever had in my whole life. So truly she's been life changing for me. So, that's just Sort of a positive experience that I've had. And like I said, that probably outside of my experiences with Zil, the rest of them aren't super great, but yeah.", "1109": "Shout out to Zil. I've worked with Zil at Mount Sinai, but... What was I going to say? I don't know if I've had... I feel like I cycled through 400 different experiences at work a day, so I don't know if I have an impactful one. I'm more so just like really... It's annoying because this is the discipline that I come from, which is obviously a more social, mental understanding of things, but I just really...", "1110": "I mean, even as I continue to work more in a hyper clinical setting, it just becomes more and more apparent to me how systemic oppression really plays a huge role on health and wellbeing. I mean, it's such an obvious thing to say, but to a medical provider, it really isn't, which is sad. And I think that, yes, we've made amazing strides with a lot of our medical teams and understanding that there's a huge barrier to care and barrier to retention within care.", "1111": "But I think it's still not completely understood and I would really want to move forward in the medical world where we don't push that onto social work. Like, \"Oh, this is social work issue,\" but it's really just... It needs to be taken very seriously as a aspect of health. And I find that nine out of 10 times it is the barrier.", "1112": "My patients experiencing domestic violence, so they're too stressed to obviously go to the hospital. Or my patient lives $100 a month and those kinds of things. And I just really don't think people factor that in. Or even when they're like, \"Oh, the copay is $3, can't they just pay that.\" I'm like, \"Well, that's a lot of money when you only make $800 a month.\"", "1113": "And I think that's really important to factor that in and how stressful that could be and how you could just avoid taking care of yourself because you have to manage other things in your life like your own mental health, or your own access to food for that month or whatever. So I'd really urge that to be more present in health and wellbeing. I mean, I feel I could say in confidence that everyone in this group understands that. But I think that it's just something that we really need to see as a huge determinant of health.", "1114": "Yeah. Thank you. Are there any more thoughts about this question? Or we can keep it moving? So Kim, I was wondering if you could speak towards how you see COVID 19 impacting the community that you're in.", "1115": "Thank you. How I see COVID impacting the community. For our community, most of all, especially for the youth, the youth some of them don't have any jobs or anything, and they depend on being out there. And being out there doing groups and stuff like that and face to face groups. So the impact that has caused throughout with the youth is that how are they going to get food to eat? How are they...", "1116": "I'm so sorry, that's what she does. How are they going to continue with housing. There's a lot of youth that are homeless and now how are they able to actually get housing still? Although they're doing telehealth and telemedicine and stuff like that. But most of the resources are at a halt, at a standstill, even on... It is really crazy that COVID-19 is not a comparison. I will never be a comparison of the epidemic back in the '80s, where I've experienced HIV and AIDS.", "1117": "However, this pandemic is so silent and you actually don't even know where it's coming from and that obvious is impacting the youth, but it's impacting myself also because as I had to do self care and make sure that the same way that I'm taking care of others, I had to pour love into myself first, before I'm able to pour love into other folks because I always do that. I'm always nurturing. I'm always pouring loving into others, and I had to...", "1118": "COVID slowed me down and made me at a stand still, although I'm feeling so miserable being at home at times if I have to work from home. So I can't even... The only thing that I've created is the Zoom and the virtual groups so that I can involve the youth, and it's kind of different as a nurturer to embrace them. So we are in a new stage of not hugging or whatever the case may be.", "1119": "So what happened and really impact me, with the youth and the community I'm part of, is the homelessness, how are they going to get food? We had to get individuals who will volunteer to take food throughout the five boroughs. Who's going to do the cooking this week so that folks sort of get... That kind of thing.", "1120": "So we all had to... But it brought a lot of us much closer that we all chipped in and folks that haven't seen each other for a very long time we're actually social distancing and the knocking on the doors or ringing bells and making sure that they have bags of food, hot food and stuff like that.", "1121": "So we're not only taking care of the youth, but we are taking care of the elders, that kind of vise and versa thing. So COVID-19 has really impacted from a negative as well as a positive. A lot of us have not only lost, and when I say lost not dead, they passed away or anything.", "1122": "A lot of us have lost friendships reason for and not to go into depth with that, but when it comes to HIV and AIDS back then the same way how some stigma was around HIV and AIDS, with this pandemic. For some folks they might not see it, but there's a lot of stigma around this pandemic that folks are saying if you have a...", "1123": "I have a compromised immune system and I don't talk about it all the time, but I realized that with some of my chosen family, it was like, \"Oh wait, hold on, we got to quarantine, we got to stand back. We got to do this. We got to...\" I mean at first it made me really, really feeling so segregated and it made me feel like no one wanted to be around me. They wanted to be so over protective over me, \"Oh, you can't go outside.\" This kind of thing.", "1124": "So I had to make choices for myself as well as for others. And yeah, COVID is something else, but I'm learning day by day mental health and I'm seeing my therapist so that day by day, I got to take care of myself and do some self care before I could pour into others.", "1125": "Thank you. Now we're actually going to be opening up all the questions from now on to everybody and also axe the circle format so you guys can speak to each other and chime in when you want. Again, so everyone is encouraged to respond to all the questions we float, but again nobody is obliged to. Everything is optional.", "1126": "So if anyone else would like to respond to this and this is our sort of kickoff broad question now, and so If you just share a little bit about how your communities and the communities you work with have been impacted by COVID-19 recently.", "1127": "I'll share. So the community that I work with is mostly first time parents, and definitely as well sometimes parents who are having babies second or third babies. But I also work with parents who are expanding their families through surrogacy. I work with queer and trans folks. I work with sometimes trans folks who are hoping to breastfeed their babies.", "1128": "And so I'm seeing that because also many of the people who I work with are people of color, and there's always been a certain level of fear especially in the Black community when it comes to birthing in the hospital. We know that in New York City that is much less safe for Black women and Black queer people who are 12 times more like to die from childbirth related causes than their White counterparts.", "1129": "And so what I'm seeing is that where before is that fear and sometimes it's sort of criticisms of the medicalization of birth and the need to have birth happen in the hospital has spread from not now being a conversation just within the Black community, but also to many other people who are turning to home births towards the idea of re-birthing outside of hospitals.", "1130": "These are conversations that we've with the queer and trans people forever because hospitals have never quite been a very safe space for us either, and so when you have these sections of multiple of those identities? We've always been finding ways to birth safely at home with midwives or an assistant.", "1131": "And so I'm seeing a lot of that kind of co-opted and there's a lot of people who otherwise would never have chosen home birth who are choosing it now as an option, but taking that choice out of fear of being in the hospital and maybe being separated from their support people which is [inaudible].", "1132": "It's also not ideal to be birthing at home if you don't feel like that's the safest place to be. So there's a lot of conversations happening right now around the work that home birth midwives do, how essential it is to marginalized communities and how that can be applied in a greater context to sort of de-medicalize also decolonize birth in this country.", "1133": "And I'm also seeing a lot of conversations about race happening in the birthing community that are sort of centered around the ways that Whiteness has really just steered the marketing of any kind of products or services towards birthing people.", "1134": "Everything is extremely whitewashed and highly feminized, it's just trans folks, and so right now it's just like a light is being shone on a lot of the problems with those kinds of race-wise dynamics in the community and the cockroaches are scattering.", "1135": "It's been really messy and in a way when it is necessary for folks to sort of examine their privilege and look at the ways that they are contributing to a system that only gets accessed by the Whites and wealthy. [inaudible]", "1136": "Thank you. Ethan, do you want to add to that?", "1137": "Yeah. I just want them to respond, Charlie. I think that the work you're doing is really important and I also just wanted to echo what you were saying about whiteness. And I had a question because a friend of mine is working on becoming a doctor and was studying this and said that more Black women are actually dying from home births because the midwives are White and untrained and don't believe when a woman is... I think something is wrong or I think...", "1138": "Because I don't really know the whole procedure here, but when they're like, \"Something's wrong,\" or, \"I'm in pain,\" they're not being taken seriously by those midwives. And so there's a higher rate of Black women dying from home births with... But there was a real specific conversation there about the White midwives, and I'm just wondering if you've heard about this, and...", "1139": "I don't know. The best way you think we can address that and sort of decolonize that practice, because for most other issues surrounding this, I feel like the home births are the better choice. Obviously not for everybody, and that is a personal choice. But I guess I do acknowledge that I know that there are so many more benefits from a home birth and getting to have your own birthing plan and have more control of the process, but how do you... Culturally, professionally is this something that y'all are trying to address or respond to?", "1140": "Yeah, absolutely. I'm really curious to know where your friend got that information, because as far as I know it's actually untrue. There's for home birth midwives... So there are midwives who practice both in and outside of the hospital and sometimes in freestanding birth clinics and those that practice out of the hospital and do home birthing specifically tend to have the best outcomes as far as the health of their patients or their clients.", "1141": "And so we're actually seeing way lower complication rates of surgery, any [inaudible] birth resulting in caesarian, any kind of tearing that might happen, and also any postoperative complications. Obviously home births are also not accessible to everyone based off of prior complications that one might have.", "1142": "So it's really an option for people who are categorized as low risk, but Black birthing people I will with full confidence say are birthing at home with midwives than are at hospitals and the problem is not... A lot of the times the problem has been kind of tends to be this kind of inter-personal bias between providers and their patients. And is just maybe midwife hospitals as well, right? Because there are midwives who do work in a hospital setting.", "1143": "But typically what we're seeing is that the hospitals, there's really big... I'm forgetting the word. Sorry. Disparity. Racial health disparity that we see in birthing in hospitals in Brooklyn specifically is based off of the care that people are receiving at a set of three minority serving hospitals, where essentially, because we live in somewhat segregated neighborhoods already, we're going to the same hospital where they're serving predominantly Black folks.", "1144": "Predominantly people who are on Medicaid and who are receiving standard care that is around 30 years behind the kinds of technology and services that are available at White folks hospitals. And so if we were to just look at birthing location alone, we could already increase people's chances of survival by around 40%.", "1145": "If we were just to have people are birthing in safer hospitals, right? It's a much larger conversation obviously here also around gentrification and just those hospitals being also taking hospital places where essentially if you're going to become a midwife in New York City they say [inaudible] you'll be working with.", "1146": "You get to see all of the range of complications that people have because you're serving a marginalized community in which there are lots of other social health factors determining the health of someone's pregnancy. Just kind of fuck that, right? It's where we see this continuing tradition of experimentation on Black bodies and it's kind of Black bodies [inaudible] and this also [inaudible] I think of a Black body. Yeah.", "1147": "Thank you. And Josh, you spoke a little bit about sort of generally how COVID has been impacting your work, please do weigh in more. I was wondering also with Ethan if you would like to comment from your own position a little bit about what kind of your conditions have been like.", "1148": "Do you want to go ahead, Ethan?", "1149": "You guys can self-determine.", "1150": "So I guess you asked within our own communities and then within the communities we work with. So I guess starting in my own community, my own immediate community, I think COVID was very interesting for queer and trans folks around me, because so much of the care we provide is in person and we are holding space for each other and in a nightlife setting where people feel safer than most other settings or just whatever.", "1151": "I think that ripping that space from us and due to quarantine and whatever. And then also thinking of all my friends who are immunocompromised and their extreme fear, which is of course not true. And trying to console that and what's best for them, and just there was...", "1152": "It just felt like a lot to deal with, because we were kind of... Or at least I'll speak for myself. I was cut off from my traditional ways of coping. So, that was a lot. And then simultaneously I was also dealing with that in a work setting. I had two people die from COVID who are my own patients.", "1153": "And yeah, I mean not that I needed COVID-19 to really expose the inequities within our health care system, but it felt like a conversation around I guess Black health was very prominent and is now in a mainstream conversation, which I think is really important to have in a mainstream conversation and very necessary. And yeah, it was just very disturbing.", "1154": "And I would say 90% of my patients have COPD, which is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease which is very scary during a time where we're living in a respiratory disease space. And so I don't know. It was just such a blur to be honest. From the 13th till the middle of April felt like 600 years of my life and holding space not only for my own immediate community and also for the folks that I worked with, the 30 people that I work with, my clients, patients.", "1155": "It was just a lot, and I feel like I almost dissociated it, it's really stored away somewhere else because it was just really hectic. And the things that my patients had to negotiate were just really intense. Obviously these people are incredibly immunocompromised. They all have extreme chronic health conditions and they had to determine like, \"Do I order food, because I literally cannot leave my house, because one, I don't have access to PPE or I can't get my groceries delivered because I live off SNAP benefits, and...\"", "1156": "There's all of these things you have to factor in. So a lot of my patients made negotiations of like, \"I'm not going to pay May rent because I need to pay for these other things, which are really costly at this moment.\" So all the things that you have to negotiate simultaneously thinking about a lot of my patients are, I would say 90% of my patients are Black and Brown.", "1157": "So negotiating all the people around them who are dying and then negotiating their own lives and making compromises in certain situations, which honestly is just a day to day thing that my patients deal with anyways, but this really put that to 100. So I hope that this movement that we're in will maybe catapult the idea of accessible healthcare and stable housing and access to reliable income for folks who may not be able to operate in this really fucking impressive environment. Sorry for my language.", "1158": "You are [crosstalk] to use whatever language you like to go on. Sorry.", "1159": "But yeah, I mean, I could literally go on for 200 years talking about that four weeks stretch, but I'll leave it at that. And I'm just really happy to share space with the other folks in this group who have lived through that experience themselves and also work with folks who are continuing to live through that experience.", "1160": "Thank you.", "1161": "Yeah. Thank you, Joshua. Yeah. And thank you again, Charlie. It's so fascinating to hear about that. I know I saw the business of being born and after I saw that, I was like, \"Oh my goodness, this whole industry is wild.\" So speaking from my context as a chaplain in Rikers, this COVID has totally destroyed my ability to see clients, which has been really, really hard.", "1162": "Because sometimes the programs people are the only people that some of the incarcerated folks get to see and spend time with. And on a base level, it feels dangerous because without any programs people in there, there's no one to hold correctional officers accountable specifically throwing people on bang, not checking on them when they're supposed to, which is what resulted in the death of Layleen Polanco last summer.", "1163": "And so it's really scary to think about. I've been able to continue to give tele-health which I suppose is better than nothing, but they're not confidential conversations because all those phone calls are recorded, and that can very much limit... So as a chaplain there very much are times when incarcerated people may confess things to me.", "1164": "And even if they're not confessing anything to do with their crime, they're often talking about very difficult information about their lives. Often very traumatic information about their lives. And so not something that many of them are going to do on a recorded phone call. So, that's been really hard.", "1165": "I cannot wait for there to be a vaccine so we can go back and be in there. And it's affected my ability to care for these folks, but it's actively also killing these folks. And so aside from just not being able to see people, my clients are actively just locked in Petri dishes effectively, unable to just do anything about it.", "1166": "As of about a week and a half ago, there was no COVID in the transgender housing unit at Rosie's, but it was in most other units. So probably a matter of time. So, that's been really hard. The positive that has come out of this, I mean, it is positive because folks are getting released. There was a mass effort to release all nonviolent offenders.", "1167": "We were able to release, I think, close to 30 people. Many of them LGBTQ, more specifically trans, and so that was really awesome. There are people who got released that I have been working with for a year, two years, pardon my language also, but just for dumb shit. For literally being a poor trans woman and maybe being a sex worker, maybe just walking and being considered a sex worker, neither of which should result in incarceration, just to be clear about where I stand.", "1168": "But just to give you an example of some of the reasons that these women have had their lives just totally ripped from them. And not just where I work but a lot of queer folks, queer community struggle with HIV status. And so to have that while in jail, during freaking coronavirus, it's just really a lot and it's really scary. And our ability to help them it was already really hard to do.", "1169": "And it's just become even more challenging and given the State more opportunities to cause harm. So it's been really challenging. I was also supposed to be starting a residency as a chaplain at Mount Sinai Hospital and that had to be pushed back for a year because I am immune compromised and the unit they wanted to put me on was the COVID unit, and so I just probably would have died.", "1170": "And so I had to wait a year and pray that there is either a vaccine or we've at least figured out a way to stop people from dying when they get it. Which I will say last time I spoke to Zil is what she is hoping for in a year's time. So little scary. But I really trust her opinion. So that's just also why I'm sharing that. So that's sort of how this has been impacting me professionally in my community.", "1171": "I'm also a parent, I have custody of my godson. So being a teacher's great, not really, it's been a lot but we're very lucky and we have a roof over our heads and all of our needs are met so I can't really complain on that regard.", "1172": "Thank you all so much. And some of you were speaking to this already and I wanted to ask... I'll remember to paste this into the chat. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more about how folks in your communities have... What strategies have been used to support health and safety in your communities, and especially what's been working, particularly things you might like other folks doing, pandemic or social justice work in general that...", "1173": "What have been kind of successful approaches that has helped you guys do your work? That might include programs, organizations, networks, or individuals that have positively contributed to safety and health under these conditions. But I will leave that as an open-ended question, as just what's been working? And I'll leave that to anybody who wants to.", "1174": "We have been doing a lot of Zoom groups. We have been doing a lot of Zoom groups and making sure that individuals could meet. So sometimes mostly on the weekends, everyday we are doing that with my work and everything. But on weekends, on Saturdays, I get a downtime, I'm able to connect with other Black and Brown trans folks and gender nonconforming folks who are doing like Zoom groups.", "1175": "Sometimes they're doing open mics, spoken word, these kinds of things. So in a day we are meeting up virtually, we're talking and we're chiming in what others need or what we need and between each other. And then in the nighttime 8:00, 9:00 we are doing open mic, sometimes we're doing poetry reading and stuff like that.", "1176": "So we've been really trying to hold on and trying to make sure that we look out for each other and make sure that... A kind of healing process that we're doing and this come from other people that's facilitating, not just myself. So it's really embracing each other and making sure that each other is feeling safe, being in-house and feeling like they're not alone.", "1177": "That's what we've been doing with the Zoom group. Although a lot of these Zoom groups are becoming overwhelming and it's like, \"Oh my goodness, another Zoom group,\" however on weekends, I get to take my hat off on Saturday and just hang out with them virtually and it's so amazing to be there, even to reach out from my book or talk about our children.", "1178": "Most of us have young children, so that kind of thing. So I really enjoy connecting and putting my provider hat down and just connecting with folks and feeling like I'm not just a provider, I'm also human being, and at the end of it I'm just a regular person. And so I really enjoy that part, especially on Saturday.", "1179": "Thank you so much, Kim, does anyone else have any thoughts on this question?", "1180": "Are you about to go Charlie?", "1181": "You go ahead if you have something to say. I'm still thinking.", "1182": "This is a great question, because this has been, especially as someone who is immune compromised then, really just on my mind and heart a lot, how can I show up now safely when I still need to be alive, take care of my family and my kid? But it's been really interesting. We haven't been able to be in the streets in the way that a lot of protesters have.", "1183": "We have a 10 year old, I'm immune compromised so we've been dropping off cases of water and finding ways to show up in these places and spaces in new, more accessible ways, which is exciting. And also a little bittersweet because I know from my partners specifically this has been really hard. They went to Ferguson when that was happening, and so for them to not be able to be physically present at this time has been really difficult for them.", "1184": "But separately from my immune system, we're both now in a parenting situation, which is just not where we thought we would fucking be right now. And so having all of this go on while that's happening has been an adjustment. The other thing I was going to say is mutual aid has been so important and necessary, and I feel like at least in my communities, we're all just like ping ponging money back and forth to each other.", "1185": "I also went to... I'm definitely... My mom is a waitress, so I'm not particularly coming from money, but I went to a really bougie seminary. And so I have tried to get all of my rich White friends to donate to organizations but also people, which is something... It's really important to donate to organizations. I don't want to take anything from that, but I really want to...", "1186": "For anyone who ever hears this or listens to it, I want to encourage folks literally just give money to Black people you know. I don't think people really understand or appreciate the value of that transfer of wealth and how important that is. Specifically as a disabled person who simply because of pandemic unemployment has had access to random lump sums of money that we didn't plan on having, so we didn't necessarily need, we've been able to like budget that in and give that away to people which has been really helpful.", "1187": "And honestly I think for White folks, White passing folks, however folks identify in that space, which I just say, because I am mixed, but I identify as White because the world sees me as a White man, so that is sort of how I move about the world. And sometimes that's the best way to show up I think for White folks. It's just give people your money and then go somewhere else. So I just really wanted to speak to how important crucial mutual aid has been at this time.", "1188": "Yes, I second that so much. Thank you Ethan. I also feel like I'm noticing how a lot of things that we didn't think were possible before the pandemic started now have just become so normalized. Like the ability to communicate with technology more and to do things remotely.", "1189": "So many companies have even allowed allow their employees to work from home, disabled folks, people with kids, people who just needed to stay home now are like, \"Oh, so it is possible. We can just Zoom for these things. We can do this.\"", "1190": "And I feel like it's opening up so much possibility or folks to just be present with each other in different ways and to be more realistically creating worlds that responds to our needs and it's adoptive and fluid and can grow with us. So yeah, I've been really proud of folks [inaudible] being so adaptive to everything.", "1191": "And now I started doing virtual consultations and where before I would only work with folks who I was building a relationship with. They would hire me at some point in their pregnancy and then I would work with them for several months and then be with them during their birth and early postpartum. And now I have kind of just opened up my services to anybody who needs advice, anybody who has question or feels like...", "1192": "If you live in state where abortion is illegal and you want to find a way to have an abortion, call me. If you are trans and you are training how to induce lactation and you live in Alabama, call me. It's so great to be able to just have really life changing conversations with people about the choices that they make about their bodies and their families from all over the country, and just knowing that I have a lot of good advice for folks. And so, yeah. If y'all know anyone pregnant anywhere, let them know. [crosstalk]", "1193": "I just want to say I think it's really cool that you focus on helping trans folks with lactation. My friend was able to find someone to help them with that, and that was life changing for their pregnancy. So that's just really awesome work.", "1194": "Yeah. It's so necessary. And also most people don't realize that whether you choose to chest feed not you're probably still going to... Your body is still going to make milk. So even if you choose not to chest feed, then you'll have to talk to someone who can help you figure out how to not do that all along. It's [inaudible] our bodies can do some wild shit sometimes [inaudible]", "1195": "And trans people need other trans people who they can call in this situation? So, that's just something that we need to have within our own community as well. And most of these trainings and certifications and stuff are really expensive. And the only reason that I was able to get certified was because a White ally, someone in my neighborhood [inaudible] just happens to make some extra money and she comes from money her family's rich.", "1196": "She was just like, \"I don't really need this, if you want to take this training I would really love to sponsor you to get the training.\" First I was really suspicious because I didn't know her yet. And that was over a year ago and now we're really good friends and she just wanted me to get my certification. She drove me to every single class and I would take the certification with me and she's been a really good mentor as well.", "1197": "So ownership when it's feeling right, also the power of just like transferring money. So powerful kind of more than other things, and it's just based on [inaudible] most people generally like to do. Because sometimes it's the quickest and most effective uplift those who need it.", "1198": "Thank you, Charlie. We're just going to not change directions, but add to the discussion a bit and ask since we're living in this moment of two profound crises, the pandemic, as well as this national epidemic of police violence, especially anti-Black violence. We'd like to ask about that too.", "1199": "We wanted to know how you see your community struggling with police violence. How has police violence impacted the health and the wellbeing of your communities? And perhaps if you could share a story about that, if you've been impacted or your community or someone you know, just to speak on those range of questions, that would be great. (silence)", "1200": "Well, let's say his name, Tony McDade. Tony McDade was actually shot by the cops in Tallahassee recently and I think that all the States especially for the trans and gender nonconforming community, we've been through, we've seen so many murders and stuff like that and to see this kind of murder happening during a pandemic is really, really scary.", "1201": "And for me, it's like... I reside in The Bronx, so I see things on television and I try not to watch television at all. I probably watch once. If I watch television in the morning, probably I won't watch it in the nighttime or I'll just wait till the nighttime so they will repeat it and I'll just watch it. Because me going out, if I'm actually going out into the streets... So one particular...", "1202": "Last Monday I decided to go to this bar that was only taking one person. And I came up with a list to be taken and I went on to get some stuff there, and after coming through there, I was leaving to come home and I had no idea or I was so blindsided that I am actually walking through Fordham road just before everything started to happen.", "1203": "And I thought that this was... Honestly, I thought that there were there this group... When I saw the cops, I saw the lights, I saw all that thing. And I try to stay away from NYPD. I'm not really a big fan of NYPD, unless it's something necessarily that I had to come up emergency come by my door necessary. I'm not a fan, however, I saw...", "1204": "I just heard the gates come on down. And then I saw all the folks have their phones and stuff up. And I'm wondering like, \"Is this shooting a movie or something like that?\" That was just my thoughts. If there was a movie being shot and I'm actually walking, not realizing that I'm actually walking through... I'm witnessing that the stores are being looted.", "1205": "However, the cops saw the folks go into a store, this jewelry store and stuff like that and pulled the gates down, so the folks are inside, and it was a scary thing for me because I call them Ninja turtles and Ethan expressed about reconciling and they normally call them visiting reconciling and stuff like that. We call them Ninja turtles.", "1206": "So to see the cops, NYPD dressed up in all this garb, all this... The mask and the whole suit and everything, it was like, \"Am I on a war line. I'm going through I'm a war,\" something like that. So I walk several blocks just to get to other bus stops, like 12 different bus stops so that I can be clear from that, but that was very traumatizing.", "1207": "And it's only when I get home, and one of my nephews called me and asked me where I was. And if I was home from work, I said, I just reached in the house. So I told him, and he was like, \"Oh man, watch the news.\" And when I to watch the news I realized that the looting really starts on Fordham it started really badly on Fordham.", "1208": "So it was really crazy for me. And I thank my sensei that things was happening that way for me. I guess somebody was guiding me on looking over me or whatever the case may be, but it was really... I didn't like that. And the whole curfew drove me crazy, because I'm a person that likes to take my pets out in the late evenings, and I like to go to the store and stuff like that and that whole carry me.", "1209": "So to have me really limited this whole thing, the police thing is really carrying and I just don't like it. I couldn't stand it. If not for being an essential worker and coming home I probably would not have that in my own right to even travel back and forth or even be outside at all. So, yeah.", "1210": "Thank you.", "1211": "Thank you so much Kim.", "1212": "I feel like I have so much to say, and I'm also scared to say anything because I'll never be able to stop, but I feel like... And also it's very difficult for me to talk about police violence right now because it's too fresh and raw. And my body healing from being broken is just... I don't even have words yet. I know I will have many words created in about a week, but right now, it's just...", "1213": "I feel like the affirmation in my body of what I've known all along, which is just that there is no such thing as a good cop, there is only an entire institution built on the policing of Black bodies and wanting to grate and crush us and our resistance to that, our survival. It's like the very institution of the cops today is only to continue to keep that racial oppression alive.", "1214": "And I just want to abolish all of it. It makes me so angry. It makes me so, so, so, so angry. So angry that I want to put my body in this kind of harm, and yet nobody deserves this and I never wanted this to happen. But I was angry enough to really put myself in danger and then to experience something so traumatic. So I just feel like there has to be...", "1215": "If we're not able now to change the world that we live in to make it safer for us, I don't know what comes next. Of course, we keep fighting and this has been like I'm not the first to have these thoughts. For generations and generations it's just exhausting. I feel like this is the next big thing that has to happen. We have to change this system. The police cannot be a part of our future, in no way, in no shape, in no form. The police needs to be abolished.", "1216": "So again with Rikers, it's a little... It's not necessarily the police, but it's the COs, which are basically just police without guns. So it's not all that different. But I guess I'm thinking about... So the question of how they impact each other, to me, they're sort of... I don't want to say the same, but just very interconnected.", "1217": "And in many ways the pandemic feels like a double smack in the face to the Black community and other communities of color because the pandemic, although everyone likes to say it goes after everybody, it doesn't matter race, gender, but it doesn't. It hits the Black community the hardest, and that's what we've seen. And so to me, they're just very interconnected and extensions of each other and thinking...", "1218": "Speaking a little bit more on the police aspect and how that has been, it's been really surreal to be in the city with a curfew that was so rigidly enforced in this way. And we tried to drop off some water during a protest to get back before curfew one night. Mostly because our arrest-ability level it needs to be zero because of our kid, and also just his safety.", "1219": "And so we didn't really think that we would be putting ourselves in most danger because we were just dropping off water. And the first day it went fine. And the second day we went and the police almost grabbed my partner while they were dropping off water, and then they threw cases of water into dumpster and then once...", "1220": "We were sort of going around the block and getting in front of the protest to leave water in the middle of the road and then hop back in the car. And we just kept doing that for as long as we could. And so the organizers and the protestors knew what we were doing. And so a couple of them ran over and got a case, but then they got nastier and ripped the water bottles open and threw them in one by one. So nobody could get them.", "1221": "And so that was a really scary moment because my partner and I were like, \"No.\" We have a plan when it's just us but like I said, having a 10 year old Black son now this has totally changed how we have to be and show up in those spaces. My partner would probably be there with you Charlie, to be totally honest, and now we can't do that. And so I just had this moment of... I looked in my rear view mirror and saw 40 police circling my partner.", "1222": "And then I looked at my back seat and saw my kid and started to get out to help my partner and couldn't. And before I could even get out my partner had already made it back to the car, thankfully, and then slammed the door, we sped off. We were fine. I mean, no. It was scary, but it became this family moment of, \"What does it mean in the police interact with us? And I'm the only White person in the house.\"", "1223": "And if the police take my partner I can't go after my partner. I have to stay with my kid and that's... I get that, but that's a fucked up choice to... No one should ever... You shouldn't have to go after anyone because no one should be killing fucking anybody and but that was a really scary moment. And really sort of shook me in just the ways that we can show up, because if it was just me and my partner, I'm just going to support whatever my partner wants to do, to be honest.", "1224": "But now we have all of these other things and thinking about the impact of this virus and the police on my community, but also on my family has been very much. I would like to think of myself as somewhat politically conscious, but this is still even in this situation been a bit of a wake up call. What is it? What does it mean to be a parent at all right now? And then to be a parent of a Black kid, is this.", "1225": "It's something that I had thought about, and then we got thrown into a catalyst for the revolution and now it means all these other things. And I also just wanted to echo that I very much feel what you're saying Charlie. My partner and I were just talking about, is it going to happen? Are we...", "1226": "And they've also been talking, I don't know if y'all are familiar with Momentum, but they're a really great organization that works to politicalize people during these exact moments of... They call this the whirlwind, so when... Ferguson was a whirlwind. This is a whirlwind and it's a really great time to politicize people and keep them active.", "1227": "And so a lot of those organizers don't think that this is it. And I'm frustrated by that and a little... It's just disheartening, because this feels so terrible. What else do we need to go through to realize that this isn't it. And so that's sort of how that's impacted us and what it's brought up for us.", "1228": "Yeah. I think we choose to make it it, if it is it, then that's up to us to manifest that to find the best of that. But no, I also want to affirm that parents play such an important role right now. Parents are playing an incredibly important role in all of this, just in the way that they're communicating to their children what it means to be human in the world. How they can be there for other people and not be racist.", "1229": "And it's a conversation that I'm having with a lot of my friends and clients just around the frustration or isolation or grief of being at home and not being able to join your community and reach in the morning and having to be at home and sort of presenting that, but also wanting to protect one's family first and not knowing what that means about that kind of isolation away from your community and how do you stay connected to your family through that?", "1230": "But yeah, I think parents are playing possibly the most important roles because you're breeding our future too and kids are so much... I don't know. I'm going to get so goofy and gully about it, but they are our future. That's our only option is to teach them not to be racist, otherwise there's no point.", "1231": "So I think whenever we see Black parents do that every day and parents of Black children do that every day and because it's not an option, because that's our reproductive choice it's to arm ourselves and protect ourselves as much as possible throughout life so that we can have that life expectancy.", "1232": "It's just not fair, but I think White parents have been hoping or observing this moment and making changes in the way that they're parenting and how they talk to their kids about race, they have to. They have to. It's not even an option. Thanks for bringing that up. (silence)", "1233": "Just very briefly, I guess. I mean, obviously... Not obviously, but I don't know. I think this topic is just so intense considering what's going on. And also to my friends in the square next to me visually there's an optic display of actual brutality. And even yes, obviously the extreme and multiple acts of violence that occur on Black bodies every day through actual physical violence, but also thinking about the violence that's inflicted by not actually funding communities is so insane.", "1234": "It's just deeply disturbing to me how much the NYPD receives and then to... I don't know, maybe if some people watched that video of that police chief being like, \"No one respects us and blah, blah, blah.\" I was just like, \"Is this real?\" I feel almost like we are gaslit by this country 24/7. And really the only people who can affirm us are people within our own community, but even they are gaslit. It's just... I'm like, \"What?\"", "1235": "I don't know. I'm just so mind fucked by what's going on in this country right now. And it's just, I keep saying this over and over again, it's... And talking to family members or people who may be in the middle of the road and not understand what's going on. And I'm like, \"Why do you not understand what's going on?\" Very simple demands are being asked. One, stop killing Black people. So it seems like a very easy ask.", "1236": "Two, invest in communities and defund these bodies that really just inflict violence on our communities, and it's so obvious. It's not like this is something that needs to be put in question. There's multiple, multiple incidences, and this has been going on for 100s of years and to just ask that, and then not even be allowed to have a conversation about it. Honestly, it's just so crazy and fuck Bill de Blasio and fuck Andrew Cuomo.", "1237": "And it's just so disgusting and disturbing and... But it is so beautiful to think of what that would look like even... And it's wow, just look at Minneapolis. That's so crazy that these people just fought so hard and got what they wanted and are leading the way in what a world without police looks like. And hopefully a world without prisons looks like. And I don't know. There's just so much potential.", "1238": "I feel my body's being torn in 4,000,000 different directions, and just the trauma inflicted by this year has been so much and the loss and, but there is joy, I guess, through the chaos. And in my eyes, the only thing that will upend so much violence and destruction and oppression and racism is extreme chaos, because it's so deeply rooted within our society. Which is really unfortunate, but when your enemy doesn't have a conscious, what do you do?", "1239": "Thank you. And Josh, you kind of hit on something that was on our list of questions that we'd want to put at you, which was kind of I would love for folks to share a little bit about what kinds of specific changes you'd like to see that would support and improve the conditions of the work that you're doing either around move for Black lives or around COVID-19.", "1240": "We probably agree on they can abolish police and prisons, but I would invite you to talk at much more expansively as you want to about what kinds of conditions would help the movements that you're involved in.", "1241": "I would definitely love to see how the pandemic came in and then so much money. First you saw the 300 million and then you saw the five billion and then you saw the stimulus checks. And then there were only certain people that are really not the poverty line, but a lot of individuals who already have money and stuff like that.", "1242": "All of that money, I would love to see re-incurred and filtered into the transgender and gender nonconforming communities. I would like all that money to come back and all those folks that got monies and all the big companies that got so much money. And then the low businesses could not get money or the small businesses could get that much money and stuff like that.", "1243": "I would love to see all those fundings being filtered into organizations that are trans-led or organizations that provide trans services, trans gender and nonconforming services, and actually see where that goes to see how useful, because the same way, how we can pull together now in a pandemic, I would love to see how those funds will create and have us really continue progressing and holding down each other.", "1244": "And I think it would make a better world for us as a community with all that monies and probably we might not know what to do with it, probably we'd be partying and having picnics and having all these social gatherings. That's what I would love to see because it's so hard. As a person that runs organization it's so hard to get funded at points, and all I would get is small funding and stuff like that, but when it comes to governmental funding it is so, so hard.", "1245": "For 12 years I've been filtering money out of my own pocket to fund my own organization and I've been successful at it however I've been doing fundraising and stuff like that. So I wish that at some point that they could take that money and just send to me, and I would probably make it much better for our folks, especially the youth and the elderly.", "1246": "Thank you. That was so helpful to hear all those different suggestions. I am for that. Thank you. Does anyone else have suggestions or comments on where things can go?", "1247": "I feel like a lot of what we said was obvious, right? Like, defund the police. I don't even want my job to exist because I don't want there to be a jail. But something that I've been thinking about a lot is what... So we're always in crisis specifically the trans community, especially Black trans women.", "1248": "And so something that we're trying to figure out if we could possibly do is we're moving and in our basement we have a lot of extra space and a private bathroom. We also have a really big backyard, which we've never had before. And so we're trying to see if there's a way that we could, when it's safe to have people in homes again, have a weekend retreat for queer folks of color to come and just get out of the city and just sleep and chill in the backyard and smoke weed or...", "1249": "Whatever the fuck you want to do within reason and hang out and just... I don't know. And offer that to folks for free. And so I'm trying to think of ways that I can be giving back to my community and also ways that I can offer specifically spiritual, emotional healing. As a chaplain, obviously that's something that's just important to me and I probably really do try to prioritize.", "1250": "And I think it'd be really cool if some of the people I know who struggle every day to just stay safe and survive, could just not have to think about their safety, their food or necessities for a couple of days. And I'm thinking of those little micro ways to help people, because I think shifting to a culture of mutual aid and compassion, I really think is how we change and create the world we want.", "1251": "And so I know that's something that me and my partner are really... As soon as we're just at this point desperate for this vaccine, because as soon as we can help people again in this weird way. And it's not even a weird, it's because of mutual aid. It's because a lot of my whole circle of friends and community, well, and my partners' is one that was sort of already practicing mutual aid.", "1252": "I think I'm going to assume that a lot of folks on this call respect and understand that culture, and that's very much... We were already sending money to and from friends and people were sending us money to survive. And so trying to shift that into a cultural norm is something that I'm really excited to see. And I think this whole pandemic situation and the recent Black lives matter protest...", "1253": "I don't know. Maybe woke some people up to the power that is in mutual aid. I don't know. So that's just where my head is at. And that's sort of like a personal thing that I'm trying to incorporate in my life separate from the obvious of just like, \"Fuck the police. Fuck prisons.\"", "1254": "I don't know how everyone identifies on this call. I identify as an anarchist. So I'm kind of like, \"We don't really need the government at all if we just want to do the whole thing right now.\" And so those are the obvious big goals that I have, but small scale like how can I help do that, and utilize the space I have and give that back?", "1255": "Oh yeah. I'm appreciating all the cookout. That's the goal effectively. I also have a friend who... Their name is Juanita Haley and they created an organization called Free Zone, which prioritizes just spiritual and emotional healing for pretty much everyone except cis White guys. And so you just go, there are all day conferences and sometimes they do retreats where they just pray, they do workshops, dancing.", "1256": "Whatever it is. I don't know. I don't enter those spaces, but it's just a really great program, and we're trying to see if maybe our backyard could be used for something like that. And so I think there are ways that we can transfer wealth even outside of money, right? I just have a huge fucking yard now, it's green and there's a fence around it and no one can fuck with us. What can we do in that space?", "1257": "And imagine what that could be like, and especially if you think about the impacts of gentrification. If the White people gentrifying neighborhoods started to... I don't know, I guess stop doing that in general, but in the ways that if they can, you give that space back. You don't have to live here, because I understand on some level we sort of all have to participate in that unfortunately, but there are ways to mitigate it, and I think make it right again.", "1258": "Teach people how to grow food with the garden, right? That's so powerful. We've been doing that for generations too.", "1259": "For our cook outs.", "1260": "For our cook outs. Yes. That's what I'm talking about, and growing up food.", "1261": "Wait sorry. I just wanted to see it really quick. What specific? I kind of like riffing off what Kim was saying a little bit. It's interesting. Obviously yes, we will survive without any of the powers that be forever and ever. And we should never rely on these powers to support us because they've never shown up for us anyways.", "1262": "Of course, we would want to transition to where our institution support us, but presently that's not happening, but in regards to what Kim was saying, it's so fucked up and sad to think that queer and trans people have had to kind of fund themselves. We've had to seek funding within our own communities, which obviously are disadvantaged anyways especially for trans folks of color.", "1263": "And I really am noticing the momentum from this movement of people redistributing wealth to TGNC communities, especially Black TGNC communities, which are obviously really disenfranchised within the society. And I really wish that momentum would just continue past this moment. And I'm seeing a lot of people pass this around and myself included with glitz and securing housing for Black trans folks who have been recently released from Rikers.", "1264": "That's really important work that needs to be ongoing. And I hope that it continues moving forward. And I hope that as what Kim was saying that there would be funding outside of our own GoFundMe sources. It's sad to think that we really just have fun.", "1265": "I mean, it's amazing and incredible and it's so awesome that our communities are committed to doing this work. But also it's sad that we just can't rely on that. And I think that for my own work and specific changes, I would really love to drop the bureaucratic nature of social work.", "1266": "We have to jump through so many hoops to secure funding and support so many communities. It's so fucked up. The amount of compliance shit that I have to do is beyond me, just to support a single person like, \"Did you do this assessment? The care plan needs to be updated? Did you do the thing? They need to make the thing, and did you fill out the 400 million documents for the thing?\" Just to access barely $194 a month for people to access food is so many hoops, which is ridiculous that we have to prove ourselves.", "1267": "And I really want to move past a society where we have to prove ourselves to provide for ourselves. And I think it's just so degrading, and also it's just so sad that so many of my clients who are in literal destitute poverty have to... Literally they will deny benefits themselves being like, \"Oh, I'm not... I don't think I deserve that.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, you do deserve that when you're literally living off 30 cents a day or whatever.\"", "1268": "But I think moving to a more socially driven society and less of a obviously policing society, but we know who the police are here to serve and obviously here to protect. And I hope that we dismantle that because... Yeah, I don't know. I could go on this rant forever. It's just so disheartening, and I'm sure so many of us here have to experience this and then I have been very happy that Kim brought that up, but...", "1269": "That's so great. I mean, that also makes me think a lot about how the privatization of everything is also a major factor in just producing bureaucratic blow that actually makes services impossible. If we had dumb, basic shit like a single pair healthcare system, like how much easier access to care would be.", "1270": "Thank you all for all of these comments. I want to be mindful of everybody's time and stamina. I want to ask again, this is... I love how everyone is kind of like hitting on questions that I wanted to ask about. I wanted to ask another question before I kind of hand it off to Aviva to kind of do wrap up questions. And you guys are speaking...", "1271": "Did we lose somebody?", "1272": "That worked out great. I came back. I wanted to ask, you guys are speaking already to a lot of the industry... Obviously the pandemic, state murder. I know things that aren't happening independently, they're so integrally tied up in each other as movements right now. And there's obviously so many ways in which these concurrent crises are limiting each other and making it more difficult to do these movements.", "1273": "And then I would invite you to speak more if you'd like about that. But I was wondering if you could also talk a little bit about whether you see any sort of new relationships or opportunities for relationships or solidarity work or coalition building that might support a kind of intersectional coalition based approach to sort of interrelated crises that we're dealing with in this moment. I'll put that... That's is kind of a long question.", "1274": "A bunch of us go on about... Because I'm sad it's made me get... We have over 45 Black or Brown individuals and a lot of them trans-led organization from Pittsburgh and stuff like that. So we thought about forming a national coalition for Brown and Black folks so that we can filter the money within sight. And we thought about how we will filter money and see how we can purchase land even if we had to have a gated community, we purchase land.", "1275": "We go to state or something like that, purchase land, build, plant food, those kind of a thing. And I think that would be so liberating to reach to that goal. And we're actually working on it. We're actually working on it and seeing how much funding we can get. We are looking at land, we're looking at housing.", "1276": "We're looking at all these kinds of things so that within the pandemic, although we just wanted to be able to do a lot of stuff for our folks and bias for us. And that is so revolutionary for us to be thinking so broadly on that broad spectrum on a national level. And instead of having to depend on the rich folks to do anything for us where we can actually do it ourselves with the hidden talent that all of us have. That kind of thing. So yeah, that's something that we spoke about.", "1277": "Kim, may I offer you a relevant resource for that?", "1278": "Sure Charlie.", "1279": "I heard that recently there's a new fund starting called the Black Farmers Fund and it's actually specifically for Black folks all along the food ecosystem. So farmers, distributors, from growers all the way to restaurant, eateries, and shops. And they are just getting started right now. They're at the founding stages, but it hopefully will be active in the coming year to gather funds and redistribute funding throughout the black community and food.", "1280": "Thank you. [crosstalk]", "1281": "Yeah. If you look them up, you'll find information about them online too.", "1282": "Thank you. If anyone has anything else to add, just let me know or else we might move to wrapping up a bit. So there's a few more questions for everyone. We were thinking about, or in thinking about this entire conversation, we wanted to know if what you've learned from others in thinking about what you've learned from others, what you'd like other people to hear from what you've gleaned from this all and what you're taking away and what would be really valuable to share outside of this discussion.", "1283": "I might even add, I don't want to limit it to this, but you might consider what do you want your local representatives to hear about needs under current conditions?", "1284": "Okay, well, I mean, Department of Mental Health and Hygiene, as someone who was brought up in the middle of this, the documentation burden and the burden that DOMH put on social services is honestly beyond me and is a huge disservice to the communities that we serve, which are the most disenfranchised communities, especially Article 31 Clinics, or Articles 39 or whatever the article is.", "1285": "And I think that they need to invest in communities without having so many like, \"Make sure that the quotas are met with the things and they get the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.\" What Kim was saying is these institutions need to fund these organizations, these communities, these groups in order for us to service these communities that are disenfranchised by a larger society.", "1286": "And I feel blessed to in a very resource heavy city, such as New York, where we can provide so many things for so many people, but also at the same time the hoops that disenfranchised communities have to jump through is insane considering the handouts that are given to people who have greater access to wealth. And as a fair... On a policy standpoint, it's like, \"Wow,\" there needs to be endless things.", "1287": "And really just realizing that social services are necessary. And it's such a crucial, crucial, crucial part of how the city keeps moving and why the city is so amazing, but it would be even greater if we could just really remove all the restrictions that are placed and the compliancy things. But yeah, that's a really hyper admin desire for me, but thanks.", "1288": "That's really real and important. Thank you.", "1289": "This is so interesting because as I stated before, I'm going to enter a case. So kind of what I really want representatives to realize or to remember is how powerful this New York City was and the country was when we all decided to focus on something. I think it's important to note that the pandemic having so many people out of work is also what allowed this movement to be so monumental.", "1290": "But I say that to say that just remember that people have power, but separately from that, I feel obviously defund the police, defund prisons, invest in local communities. And just fund... So something that I'm really just thinking, specifically because you said the mental health department I'm really thinking of is my partner's going to school right now to become a therapist, and it's a really important goal for them because they are Black and they want to give care to Black people.", "1291": "And that's something that I really... I don't know how to formulate that clearly to a representative, but make it fucking possible for Black people to get a master's and become a therapist. Because my partner the shit has been so traumatic for them to just navigate through elite academia.", "1292": "And they go to teacher's college so they're at a really good fucking school because they're really fucking smart and it's traumatic and it's hard and it's expensive and it's inaccessible and we've almost had a call of quits several times. And the pandemic just added another year to their program. But on a more separate from the pandemic, just institutionally.", "1293": "Make it fucking possible for people to get that far in school. Make it possible for Black people to give care to Black people because there are so many institutional red tapes that White people just created to be like, \"You don't know what's best for yourself, for your own people,\" and they do. And so empower those people to create the care that they need for themselves, if that makes sense.", "1294": "And I don't say that to... I don't want that to sound like White people don't have work to do or shouldn't be doing some other shit too, but I really think if we could just... It would just be so cool if what comes from this, especially, because we've seen a serious mental health. I don't know the right word, influx, people just being locked in isolation for so long.", "1295": "I got a really, really small, barely taste of what it is to be locked in isolation, right? And just not be able to talk to anybody like so many incarcerated people go through and much more severe situations and standards. But we're seeing an influx of mental health and it would be really cool if Black people could go to their own therapists and I think having that probably goes more broadly.", "1296": "I'm sure Hispanic folks would love to have therapists that understand their culture and their family dynamics and so just I'm thinking about those things and how can we get those people the tools. And also it's institutional, but maybe it isn't always going to be academia I think other cultures have figured out ways to take care of each other that don't involve getting a master's, but I digress. That is all I have to say about that. And this has been a great conversation. So thank you everybody.", "1297": "Is there anyone else who would like to comment on the things you want the powers that be to here right now? We'd love to invite any additional comments.", "1298": "I just want to say also, yes thank you so much. This conversation has been really helpful for me. And just hearing the ways that you all are thinking as well, it's like we're so grounded in what the needs of our communities are, and then just finding any... Getting that by any means necessary. It's so beautiful and just gives my heart strength.", "1299": "I want to see all of this. I want to see the cookouts and I want to see us thriving. I want to see our vitality so strong. And it's really beautiful that those of us who do that work every day always have being able to adopt to, because there's multiple crises around us. What's the question again? I'm sorry. I've been so focused on time management, and just trying to get through with the conversation.", "1300": "No. Don't sweat it. Don't sweat it. [crosstalk] If there's anything you would like policymakers, journalists [crosstalk]", "1301": "Oh yeah. Oh my God.", "1302": "... know what they need to know about how you are living through reality right now.", "1303": "The first thing and the biggest thing I feel since the beginning of this pandemic it's just been how do we not have single-payer healthcare yet? And it's not too late. We can still pass the Health Act. We just need more of our legislators to sign, that's it.", "1304": "And if all these times that we have been sitting at home, if there's many going through the New York Health Act. It's just right now the movement is being pushed forward by many activists on Twitter mostly, but also just within... It's like all of these conversations are happening with the same people and we need more people to know about it to make a change.", "1305": "So we need to have single-payer healthcare in New York because it would radically change and increase the accessibility of healthcare for all New Yorkers, including undocumented people including [inaudible]. It's just I think the main thing that needs to be addressed right now.", "1306": "And the other thing is just that our governor is really racist and he has had a long history of prioritizing the rich and homeowners in New York, and it's actually defunding and impoverishing our neighborhoods, our education systems or hospitals, all of our facilities. This has been...", "1307": "This crisis is definitely impacting Black folks very heavily, and because of an intentional and long history of the oppression of Black folks in New York City. And our government is 100% supporting that. So I just feel like it's really a time for new leadership, new legislation and hopefully anarchy. I'm with Ethan on that one. But I don't know.", "1308": "I just feel like if anything, we're not done yet, but we are only just getting started, there's so much fighting to be done. And I feel like something is really changing right now. But yeah, I don't know. That's kind of [inaudible] to say.", "1309": "I would love this government to know that although the transgender and gender nonconforming non binary community as this day, the government has demonized us. The government has tried to remove us from being visible. The government has tried to erase our narrative. I just want the government to know, because we were...", "1310": "Last year was the Vigil March, the trans march, and I'm one of the ambassadors to New York City. And I just got a call yesterday that we're going to take it to the ground in October. So we will be back in the White house, in front of the White house and march on Pennsylvania Avenue to let the government know we should not be erased, and it doesn't matter what has happened during this pandemic.", "1311": "I think that the transgender and gender nonconforming community throughout all earth have really proven itself and not allow the government to erase us or erase our narrative, and we have kept being visible. It doesn't matter how much, whether we protest in person in the streets, on social media, whatever the case may be. We have taken on each platform and let government know, let everyone know in charge, that we will continue being visible and we will continue being progressive on what we need. Not a want, what we need.", "1312": "And I just want the government to know that we should not be erased. This is our narrative and we're a part of this country, and we're going to continue being part of this country, whether we be immigrants... Because I'm an immigrant. I'm from Barbados and I mean the fight that I watch and I go through, no one... I don't even speak about it.", "1313": "The fight that I go through I'm like, \"Are they're really crazy. Do they understand what a person as immigrant is leading and being a leader in this country? What kind of substance that they're getting. You don't like...\" So when people talk about that, I'm like... Sometimes I got to raise my hand and say, \"Don't you hear my accent? I came from Barbados.\" Those kind of things.", "1314": "I came here, broken down so many barriers. They told us that we could not get married. I did that. They told us we could not have children. I did that. They told me I couldn't own a company. I did that. They told me I could not go to school. I did that. What else are you going to tell me? Every time they told me, \"No,\" I use no as an opportunity.", "1315": "I want the government to know that, that nothing that they're telling me, because when one door closed, that closed is not... That don't make me be a failure. That gives me the opportunity to look at the other door and open it up because there's something behind that door for me and I will continue pushing.", "1316": "I will continue hitting this ground running and pushing and bringing my siblings along. Bringing folks along that I've carried for so many years. It doesn't matter what they do. I will continue pushing. That's what I want the government to know. I shall never be erased. Yeah.", "1317": "Everyone. That was just the most gorgeous, prophetic, generous giving that we needed to hear. Thank you.", "1318": "Thank you.", "1319": "I guess, unfortunately I just have to say some scripts to conclude this and then we can hang up, but I'm so... Thank you for staying a little overtime with us. I really, really appreciate your time. First of all, does anyone have any questions for us? Or are we okay? Okay. We are okay.", "1320": "So I'm just going to read the thing really quickly. It just says, \"Just a reminder that this will be transcribed and indexed and eventually shared with journalists, public officials and participants in the Local Voices Network.\" We encourage you to look at the Local Voices Network if you want to convene with other groups. Thank you so much for joining us. And also you should know that you are able to redact comments.", "1321": "If you request, you can look at the transcription of the conversation, so that's available to you and we can share that email with you and that that should be submitted ASAP. But I guess you would have to get the transcription first and perhaps you all who is on this call can speak more towards that. And I think that's it for us, right AJ?", "1322": "This is for us to stop recording already, but I will do that [crosstalk]", "1323": "Sorry.", "1324": "... so that at the end I can remember to tip us a little bit earlier on.", "1325": "Wonderful. Welcome to this conversation of the Cortico's Local Voice Network in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I have begun recording at this time, and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each others lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationship with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices in these other community to candidates, local policymakers and members of the media. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation.", "1326": "Local Voice Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experiences, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information.

We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and to learn from others in the conversation. And to support those goals we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They are also on the materials we sent with your confirmation email. So number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share the time. So this is allowing others to finish speaking, take turns, explore, share, curious ... Sorry. Stay curious, ask honest questions. Five, pause. Take time for reflection. Six, listen generously. Assume both intentions while ... Sorry. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Seven when possible close unnecessary programs, applications, notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone on board with these guidelines or is there anything else that you would like to add? So I'm going to go around again, ask you to unmute yourself and just let me know that you're onboard.

Jaelarae.", "1348": "Yeah.", "1349": "Awesome. And Chris.", "1350": "Yeah.", "1351": "Perfect. All right. So we're going to move on. For the ease of this virtual conversation, we are going to use the modify circle process where each person will take a turn. I'm posting the order in which people will be invited to respond in the chat box. I hope this will help us transition from one person to the next. You also have the opportunity to pass or pass and ask for us to come back to you. All right. Does anyone have any questions? And if you do have questions, feel free to ask. If you don't have any questions, you can stay muted, but what I'm going to be doing is posting the order in which everyone will be speaking. Oops. All right. So in the chat, you will see the order in which we will be speaking. Don't worry. I also will be calling on you each time. So I will kind of keep track of that. Okay. So to begin, we want to do a quick round of introductions. Please share just your first name.", "1352": "In addition to your first name, please share a little background information about who you are, like where you live or what you do, and a value that is important to you and how it is related to what brought you here today. So I'm going to repeat that once again. You're just sharing your first name. You also kind of giving us a little bit of background, like where you live or what you do. That could be where you work, where you go to school, et cetera, any value that is important to you. So I'm going to start. So my name is Emanuel. Most of you know me as Gregory as well. I live in New Jersey, however I do work on Staten Island. So I work at the College of Staten Island. I worked for NICET. Something that I value is just the youth and students. The reason why I value youth and students is because I truly believe that you are the future.", "1353": "And the more that we pour into you guys, the better society will be in the long run. So I'm going to go around and we're going to start with Elygah. So once again, your name, and your background, and what do you value?", "1354": "My name is Elygah. I live in Richmond Terrance. I'm living by myself. I like working with my hands. I value my family.", "1355": "Perfect. Donte.", "1356": "My name is Donte. I live in Staten Island.

All right. So we're going to move on. The next thing we would like to do is invite you to share a little bit about yourself. Since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I would like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing looks and feels like to you. So just take a few seconds, 10 to 15 seconds, to just think about it. What does health and wellbeing look like? And what does that feel like to you? All right. So I'm going to move on. Next, think of a time, place, or a story when you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. So some questions to think about, right? What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel? We will go around one at a time to share our stories. Please remember that this is being recorded.", "1368": "So we ask that you do not ... Well, so we ask that you not disclose any sensitive, personal information or use the names of other people when telling your story, all right? I'm going to start it off. So I felt I was my healthiest last year. The reason why I felt that is just because of everything that's kind of been going on this year with the pandemic, with COVID, now with an unarmed black man losing his life. I just felt like this year just brought a lot of just pain, and death, and just things that are just wasn't expecting. So I would definitely state once again, I felt my healthiest last year. Some of the things that were in place last year, just normalcy. I think everything was kind of normal. Whereas, we know this shit is not normal. And during that time, I remember just feeling like 2020 was going to be a great year.", "1369": "And so far, I just felt like it hadn't started off that way. So we're going to go around. We got to start with Elygah. If you need me to reread the questions I have no problem doing so.", "1370": "A point where I felt my healthiest, I'd say today. Not today, like this month and last month because I-", "1371": "So yeah. What do you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness and how did you feel?", "1372": "I'll say when I started getting more cause for work and everything.", "1373": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "1374": "I noticed I started getting paid more better and that's like my money and stuff than the few previous years and stuff.", "1375": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Perfect. Thank you. Donte.", "1376": "I feel like two years ago I was the healthiest because like this year's been already bad. And last year, this is dumb, but I'm missing a girl. She moved out. So she [inaudible] her life right now.", "1377": "Okay. All right. Thank you. Taz.", "1378": "I don't know. [inaudible 00:11:54].", "1379": "That whole [inaudible 00:11:56].", "1380": "Hold up. Let me figure out. All right. He put it back on mute. I'm sorry Taz. I apologize. When do you think you felt like your best? Right? Just mentally, physically, spiritually. When was like the last time you could think of when you felt that way?", "1381": "Maybe about a week or two ago?", "1382": "Yeah.", "1383": "With my sister.", "1384": "And where did y'all go, do you mind sharing?", "1385": "[inaudible 00:12:23].", "1386": "All right, so you went away. That was awesome. And what made that special?", "1387": "Because I got to see my sister after eight years.", "1388": "Wow. That's awesome. Thank you for sharing that. Lovonia.", "1389": "I guess I felt my healthiest this year because I haven't gotten sick yet.", "1390": "All right. And all right. So you felt you helped you with this year because you haven't gotten sick. I got you. Thank you. Jaelarae.", "1391": "I felt my healthiest like last month when I got my GED.", "1392": "Oh, wow. All right. That's amazing. And how did that make you feel getting that GED?", "1393": "I was really excited because I was studying really hard.", "1394": "Thank you. Congratulations.", "1395": "Thank you.", "1396": "Chris.", "1397": "I felt healthy this year.", "1398": "And what about this year? What made you feel that way?", "1399": "Because last year I was eating mad junk food and stuff like that. This year I'm eating fruits and vegetables and stuff like that.", "1400": "All right. So you're eating healthy?", "1401": "Yeah.", "1402": "All right. Well, that's wonderful. And how'd that made you feel kind of switching from a junk food to better food options?", "1403": "Yeah.", "1404": "No, how has that made you feel? That's the question.", "1405": "I don't know. It just [inaudible 00:14:10].", "1406": "All right. I got it. Thank you. All right, so we're going to move on. So now we want to move on to a conversation about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly, right? And share about either your neighborhood community or your social community. So your social community would be like your friends, your neighbors, your family members when you are responding to this question. So once again, think of your community broadly. Think about either your neighborhood community or your social community when you are responding to the following questions that's going to follow this. If you are speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you are thinking of when you share your story. So if you're thinking about like Stapleton, you want to make sure that you mentioned Stapleton, right?", "1407": "If you're thinking about Staten Island, you want to mention that. If you think about Georgia, you want to make sure you just mentioned that. If you're thinking about a particular person who might say a cousin. All right? So the first question is, I've got a few questions ... Sorry. So I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope this will be a time for some back and forth amongst you, as you share your stories. So once again, if, let's say, someone says something that kind of resonates with you, feel free to ask a follow up question. Feel free to kind of mute yourself and jump in, et cetera. I might ask other people, \"Hey, what do you think about that?\" So I invite you to respond to points that resonate, right? Once again for you, when they are made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has that opportunity to do so.", "1408": "So I promise everyone will get a turn.

So I'll pass it to you, Rezwanda.", "1626": "Yule, can we also add pronouns to that too?", "1627": "Absolutely, yes. And my pronouns are he, him, his. Perfect, thank you.", "1628": "Thank you.", "1629": "All right. Rezwanda, would you like to go next?", "1630": "What do I need to say?", "1631": "Just your name, a little bit about who you are, what you do and a value that's important to you.", "1632": "My name is Rezwanda [Ahmed]. I'm a student. I go to Brooklyn College, freshman. And I am an AmeriCorps member. That's it. Pronouns, she, her, hers.", "1633": "All right. Thank you. Wesley, you're up.", "1634": "What's going on everyone? My name is Wes. Pronouns are he, him, his. I'm originally from Westchester County, but I currently live in Brooklyn, New York. I'm the program director for Project Speak Out Loud. We've got Kqa in the building. What's up Kqa? It's a LGBTQ youth education programming. And my values are pro-black and pro-youth.", "1635": "Perfect, thank you. I see you're next, Rasheed.", "1636": "Hey, what's going on, guys? My name is Rasheed [inaudible] assistant director at Unity Plaza Community Center, East New York, Brooklyn. Currently live in Staten Island right now. My pronouns are he, him, his. And I think the biggest value I'm dealing with right now is leadership, just really focused on how can I be a better leader.", "1637": "Awesome, thank you. Kqa.", "1638": "Hi, everyone. I'm Kqa. I'm also down here with Wes. I'm from P-SOL, Project Speak Out Loud, and we are an LGBTQ health and sex education group, solely based on teens, taught by teens and for teens. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I am from the Lower East Side, Manhattan, but I was born and raised in East Harlem. We moved down here, what, 10 years ago? And now this is my home, so nice meeting you all.", "1639": "Thank you. It's Matee, right?", "1640": "Yeah, it's Matee, but it's okay.", "1641": "Matee. All right. I'm going to get it right before this conversation is over.", "1642": "My name is Matee [inaudible]. I was born in Africa and raised in Philadelphia. My pronouns are she, her, hers. I go to Fredrick Douglass Academy, a senior. And a value is basically having those that I love around me.", "1643": "Perfect. Thank you. We'll go to you, LaRhonda.", "1644": "My name is LaRhonda. You said what are my pronouns? My pronouns are she, her and hers. I'm from Unity Plaza. I'm a group leader, and one of my values are ... I was trying to think of that while y'all was talking. One of my values are ... I don't really know right now. I'm kind of struggling with that question, so can we come back to that after?", "1645": "Absolutely, absolutely. Take your time. Actually, what I'm going to do now is also I'm just going to post everybody's names in the chat. I don't know if everyone can see that. But that's going to be our speaking order, just to make it a little bit simpler so we know who's next, who's before, who's after. And so after LaRhonda is Kumani.", "1646": "Hello, my name is Kumani. I'm from Brooklyn. I'm in college right now, soon to graduate. My major is community health. Pronoun he, him. Value is my family and just trying to make them proud.", "1647": "Thank you for sharing. Pass it to you, Lewis.", "1648": "Hi, my name is Lewis. I'm from Washington Heights, and currently right now I'm staying in the Bronx at my brother's house. I go by he, him, his. Something I value is a way to better myself and give myself more confidence because I guess it's anxiety, I'm not sure. But I kind of want to [inaudible] myself a lot, but build my confidence.", "1649": "That's perfect, thank you. Kimberly.", "1650": "Hello, [inaudible] Kimberly [inaudible]. My [inaudible] are she, her and hers. And I'm a [inaudible] member, and [inaudible]. I go to City State College, and I was a freshman. Now I'm going to be a sophomore next semester. And my values are my family, members of my church, and for the moment that's all.", "1651": "Thank you, thank you all for sharing. Let's get into a bit more of the brunt of the conversation now. Thank you again for the introductions, it was awesome. So the next thing we'd like to invite you to do is share a little bit about yourself. And since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute about what heath and wellbeing look and feel like to you.", "1652": "So next you can think of a time, a place or a story where you felt that you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, what were some of the factors that contributed to that, to your health and wellness and, overall, how did you feel? So we can start with you, Rezwanda and go in our order. But, again, if anybody decides they feel like chiming in on this question, please.", "1653": "This is [inaudible].", "1654": "Sorry, one more time?", "1655": "[inaudible].", "1656": "I think you're muted out, sorry.", "1657": "Could you put the questions in the chat?", "1658": "Yeah, I can try to do that, definitely. But for-", "1659": "Yule, I'll add them to the chat. I already have them.", "1660": "Okay, perfect. Cool. Thank you. Again, I'll repeat it as well. So think of a time, place or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. So what can you remember about why you felt were at your best and what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at that time. And overall, just had did you feel when you were at your best?", "1661": "I can start, just for example. I felt healthiest in my life when I was really just entering, I guess, college. And I think that was the point in my life when I was most in control of my health because I had to be. Before that you're in high school, your parents help you out with a lot of stuff, and at that point, I really had to take command of my health. I had to make sure I was doing all the right things. I was taking all the right things and supporting that. So I think that, for me, was the time in my life where I felt most healthy because I was definitely in control of myself and my health and really took it more seriously. Awesome. We can pass it to you, Rezwanda. Or if anybody else wants to share at this time, that's also fine.", "1662": "I can think about health. I think, for me, I think health starts at my mental health, so if I don't feel mentally well, I don't think I would really be able to accomplish much in terms of a professional, maintaining friendships, maintaining relationships. So in terms of a time, I would say it was a time in college where I felt the most healthy, where I had the most support from friends and the most support from being in a close partnership. So I would say that mental health is the most important aspect of health for me.", "1663": "Awesome, thank you for sharing. Anyone else? And [crosstalk].", "1664": "Is it possible to keep the same order or call on people like you did before?", "1665": "Yeah, let's keep the same order. And, definitely, if you feel like skipping also, please feel free to do so. That's allowed. So, Rasheed, you'd be up next.", "1666": "Interestingly so, I want to say maybe the last five years of my life I've felt the most healthiest. I have to say in my youth I ate terrible, but because I was physically active and I stayed on my feet a lot I can't really say that I've felt any health challenges, but I think that was because I was just younger and I had a metabolism that just would run off the bad things that I would eat.", "1667": "But I would say having my own apartment, being able to control the energy where I live, playing basketball on Sundays, working out during the week, removing myself from some of the negative spaces that I was in, some of the negative friends that I had around me and some of the negativity that comes along with which you associate yourself with, whether it's gossip, whether it's trauma. I could say definitely maybe the last five years have been super in clarity in my life.", "1668": "Thank you.", "1669": "All right, so now I'm going to open it.", "1670": "Kqa.", "1671": "Yes. I'm sorry, what was the question again?", "1672": "Got you. The question was, basically, think of a time, place or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness, and now it's in the chat, look at that. And what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, what are some of the factors that supported it, how did you feel?", "1673": "That's an easy question. So, it was not too long ago. I think last year when I was a sophomore in high school we did this production play. And it was a really small play, and it wasn't nothing big, but we were imitating the play Chicago. And it was so much fun, and I just felt like at my absolute best, and I felt really good and really energetic. And I think it was because we were working together so well. We had been working so hard for the play, and it just came out so great. And we were working so hard at it, and it was just so great. We got to perform it for three nights, and it was just amazing. And it was really cool how we were able to work together. It was really great. I felt like I felt that way because I felt like I accomplished something working so hard at something, and then just watching it all come together is a beautiful then. And I felt like we did it as a team, so that was even more of my amazing moment.", "1674": "That's awesome. Thank you for sharing. Matee. That's how you pronounce it, right? Did Matee just leave?", "1675": "Yeah, it looks like Matee is no longer in the chat.", "1676": "And I did it wrong, anyway, again, so she had every right to leave. All right. Let's move on to LaRhonda. Oh, there we go. Actually, hold on, give me one second. Matee just got kicked out, but I think she's on her way back. One second. All right, let's move on until she gets back, so moving on to LaRhonda.", "1677": "A time that I can recall feeling at my best. I do makeup, aside from me being a group leader at Unity, and every time I do someone's makeup and I'm able to make them feel good, it makes me feel good. So every time I have a client I feel at my best.", "1678": "Awesome. Thank you. Kumani.", "1679": "A time I felt at my best health-wise was in high school I played basketball for three years. I didn't have the body that basketball players have, so I made it my duty to go to the gym every day, get bigger, get stronger, and I ate healthier. And my last year I won an award for most improved, so that's an accomplishment, and that's when I felt at my best health-wise.", "1680": "Thank you, Kumani. Lewis.", "1681": "I think a time that I felt good and healthy was before corona happened when school ended, because I feel like while I was in school I was a lot more active and I was on my feet. And I would be outside more, and go to work skateboarding, so more active. So at that time I felt good, I felt healthy. And I had a better state of mind. I was less stressful than I am now, so that's pretty much it.", "1682": "Thank you. Kimberly.", "1683": "I remember that my best time was when I was around 15 to 16. I was taking classes of TaeKwonDo, and I was pretty healthy. I was very active, and that year I was also in Mexico. So over there you are always doing something, so I was very active at that time. But when I came to the US it was very hard. I get more stressed than usual. And I don't do exercise or nothing like that anymore. I'm mostly doing going to school, work, and doing homework. But I remember at that time I was more excited to go out. Now I'm more like introvert.", "1684": "Thank you. I'm going to move on to our next question now. Thank you, everybody, for sharing again. We're going to move onto conversations about your hopes and concerns for your health and wellbeing in your community. And for the purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of your community broadly. So it could be your social community, it could be your church community, whatever community resonates most with you. And newly, I think one of the communities that we have now is this online community that a lot of us are creating. So share either about your neighborhood community, social community. When you respond to certain questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share which community you're thinking of when you share your story.", "1685": "So I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope there's still some time for some back-and-forth among you. I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they're made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. And so the question that we're going to start with is what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing, and what are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. And I'll pass it to you, Wesley.", "1686": "I'm sorry, am I up, or is Rezwanda?", "1687": "No.", "1688": "It is Rezwanda, sorry.", "1689": "[inaudible].", "1690": "I can go if Rezwanda is muted at the moment. In terms of what community am I speaking of, I grew up in a historically black Baptist church. Rezwanda, we're right in a chat, thank you. And I felt that in that community I felt a very strong sense of family where, although we weren't connected by blood, I would call people my aunts and uncles, and I called people my cousins and brothers and sisters. And I think growing up on that community allowed me to, one, treat other people with respect and dignity, and then also treat myself with respect and dignity. I hope that kind of answers the question.", "1691": "Thank you. I'm going to move onto you, Rasheed.", "1692": "Yule, could you clarify the question one more time?", "1693": "No problem. All right, so the question is what in your community is working well to support you and your health and wellbeing? So what are some of the people, places or things that has positively contributed to your community's health and wellbeing? And if you have have a story from your experience that will help us understand it a little bit better, please share.", "1694": "I would rather focus on when I was younger because now it's a little easier because I'm more of an adult. But in my teen years, I would say having like a Beacon program was real positive because they kept us off the streets and gave us some physical recreation. We would go play basketball. There was a weight room and some times we could lift a little bit of weights. And I would say that was a physical structure in our community that supported our mental wellbeing and also physical wellbeing. And I would say that then in terms of food and things like that, I can't really say if it was those accesses, but definitely at the school programming when I was a teen growing up.", "1695": "I'm going to have to agree with Rasheed. Afterschool programs really helped me, and they still are contributing and helping me. Right now my afterschool center, they give out masks and gloves to their kids in the community, and they were doing that yesterday. And I think it was the whole week, were helping, handing out things, and I was like, \"Yeah, this is dope because I need this.\" And so it was very helpful. Also my church, I grew up in a church my whole life. And they have helped me live my [inaudible] also, find myself, in a sense, and how to work with myself. I don't know if that makes any sense.", "1696": "Thank you. Can we go with LaRhonda next?", "1697": "I'm going to use my social community, meaning my friends. They help me with everything, from mental, just being overall a good support system. I go to my circle of friends for everything, and they always come through.", "1698": "All right. Kumani, you're up. Did Kumani leave?", "1699": "Yeah, Kumani is actually going to have to head out to take care of some school work.", "1700": "Oh, no problem. All right, awesome. We'll pass it to you, Lewis.", "1701": "So, I'm not sure if it's with the community. So we receive a box every week from the government, it comes with food. I guess it's like grocery food, and it happens because my brother was diagnosed with a disability where one of his legs is completely dead, so he walks with a cane. And he receives the box, and then, I guess, something that's happening in a couple of weeks is a barbecue that's happening on the block that we're celebrating something to have some fun. They're inviting the whole block, so it's like a block party. So we're having a cookout, so it's pretty cool.", "1702": "Awesome. Thank you, I'll see you at the block party. I just invited myself. Next we can go with you, Kimberly.", "1703": "Come by, come by.", "1704": "All right. Got you. You've got to drop the details in the chat.", "1705": "Awesome.", "1706": "Kimberly, you're up.", "1707": "For me, I think I have two. One I think is my church. I think church is part of my life because I go there every Saturday, but we also [inaudible] every [inaudible] in the week. And that's the first people who welcomed me when I came to New York. And they've been always buy my side. They're really helping me a lot. And the second community will be when I first started with [inaudible] because they helped me to be more professional, to understand what was happening in the community and kind of being more independent. Those two were my communities that helped me a lot the grow during my high school years and until now.", "1708": "Awesome. Thank you. We're going to move on to our next question.", "1709": "Guys, if you have any questions [crosstalk].", "1710": "And that is what would a New York City where everyone could be healthy look like, and that feel like? It's a short question, but it's definitely not a simple question. You can take a minute to think about it, if you want. And, again, to repeat, the question is what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like, and what would that feel like? When you're ready, Rezwanda, you are up first.", "1711": "I think the New York City would look like where everyone can be healthy. If the streets are clean, like when we walk on the street we see a lot of garbage, stuff that are really stinky or smelly. So I think if there is no [inaudible]. If there is no dirty stuff on the street, then people can walk freely. They won't have to smell anything, and it won't be effect on their health because sometimes when I smell something stinky, we feel like we are going to throw up, and then it make us unhealthy. So I think this is one thing that ...", "1712": "I agree partly with Rezwanda. I think a healthier New York City would look like a city that is not so stratified, that doesn't have so many inequalities or inequities, and especially in poorer communities and poorer communities of color. So I think Rezwanda was kind of speaking to a concept called environmental racism where poorer communities, let's use the South Bronx for example, are experiencing higher rates of asthma. And I think health, I also think of mental health and kind of intellectual health. If a better education for lower income communities, better education for communities of color, I think that's the route I'm taking in terms of a healthier New York City. I'll pass it to you, Rasheed.", "1713": "Healthy New York City would start, to me, with schools implementing health and wellness from pre-K all the way into high school graduation and with a thorough education on access to healthy resources, resources specifically there. It's communities coming together to demand more access to quality health care, quality fresh fruits in their community, better options for the food choices that they have in the supermarkets because, unfortunately, whatever the supermarket purchases you just get. So if there are gluten-free things or if there is organic options that exist in a Whole Foods or in a Trader Joe's, but where you're located at there's only a Key Food or a C-Town, you might not be able to have access to those things.", "1714": "So I think an overall consciousness and understanding that can begin in schools, that can be on poster boards, that can be much more of a community-based effort and not singled into an individual household could help the health and the wellbeing of the community, as well as just New York City having a tone of peace, clarity and mindfulness. We are the busiest city in the world and the most diverse city in the world. So having that, there are gifts and so many different types of foods that we can have access to that should be able to be at a little bit more easier access to us. And at the same time, so many things that we can learn from one another spiritually-wise, health-wise, so many different religions and spirituality choices that people have where we can begin to come together to share some of the things that are needed to quiet the noise and rid some of the anxieties that come along with living in a city that doesn't sleep.", "1715": "Wow, you guys have the answers, it's hard to follow that up. But for me, a better New York City would be peace and acceptance. I know it's really clich\u00e9, but I would really just love for everybody's differences to be accepted, no matter how we feel about it. I feel like if we are all accepting some parts and be open-minded to things that we're not used to, then that would just make us a little bit better than the city we are in today.", "1716": "LaRhonda.", "1717": "I'm going to skip this question.", "1718": "Sure. Kumani. Kumani is not with us. Lewis.", "1719": "I think something, a better New York would be like less homeless people because I feel like we should give more to the community to help the homeless to get them to have a good life, a longer life because people don't really deserve to be that alone in their life because it's just tough.", "1720": "Great. Thank you. Kimberly.", "1721": "I was thinking about the way Rasheed mentioned before about in the low communities, we don't have resources helping and those kind of services, like being able to [inaudible]. Everything is more nicer. The streets are more clean. The stores and restaurants are more available, but then in other communities we don't have that. And everything looks like, I don't know, it's like we don't have the same attention. Also, I think the buildings, they don't [inaudible] the minorities, we don't have the same [inaudible] water, the way that some buildings don't have the environment. I think that is one of the things that I have heard in my community.", "1722": "Thank you, everybody, for your input, again. I think I have one more question, and it's just for you to think about this conversation as a way to raise your voice beyond this group. And so for our last question, we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you would like other people to hear? Take a minute to think on it, if needed. And when you're ready, Rezwanda, we'll start with you.", "1723": "I need a moment. What is one thing that you heard today you will be talking [inaudible] to hear? So I think one thing that I heard today is how can I make the New York City healthy, like what should I do? So I can talk with the people about this, and then I feel like they should hear about this so that we all together can make the New York City healthy. You know what I mean?", "1724": "I do. Thank you. Wesley?", "1725": "I really identify with a few things shared today. Rasheed's comments on mindfulness stuck with me. I think due to the high paced environment of New York City, it can lead to a lot of mental health challenges, like Rasheed mentioned, in terms of anxiety. I think mindfulness is something that's really important for us to implement in schools and afterschool programs and in our own personal lives.", "1726": "I'm an aspiring social worker, so I really definitely connected with Lewis' comments on homelessness. I don't think there's no way we should live in a city or a country that has this great amount of wealth, but we can't find true solutions to ending homelessness. I'll say those are the things that stood out to me from today's conversation. I'll pass it to you, Rasheed.", "1727": "What stood out to me is how clear it is that New York City doesn't really offer that much health and peace, how easy it is for us to kind of literally look outside our windows and be like, \"Wow, if I wanted to eat a certain meal, it would be really hard to get that right now. Or, if I wanted to take a walk to a park to sit down as a black person, you might have a completely different experience in your neighborhood park than someone else in a Chelsea neighborhood park.\" So there's so much work that needs to be done in terms of us creating the necessary spaces.", "1728": "And I think the biggest thing that's kind of sticking out to me right now is the leadership that we have to have in order to create the spaces that we need in our neighborhoods and not allowing it to be weighed on a council member or on a community leader. I remember growing up with block associations where the block came together and threw a big party on a block. So how can we start navigating some of the things that we can do as people before it gets into a whole political tape process, but what it is that we can do as leaders of our community to bring some of that access to quality life that we need in our neighborhoods, even if it's simple green spaces and farmers' markets that can come on the weekend so we can gather some items, or demanding the corner stores to have better things like we see in the Jewish community. There's a lot of work to be done.", "1729": "Preach. Kqa.", "1730": "One thing that I'm going to be taking away from this meeting is everyone's agreement and wanting to spread a little bit more love in New York City. And it kind of is inspiring me to want to do something good myself, like sharing a little love and acceptance to everyone in my own special way. I don't know what that is yet, but it's nice to hear everybody speaking on peaceful things.", "1731": "Awesome. We are Lewis.", "1732": "Something that stood out was when Rezwanda was talking about keeping the streets clean because something that me and my brother do is when we go out to skate or head out, we like to make sure that we always clean up when we get snacks or something, always clean up. So if we were to drop something we always force the other person pick that up, go throw it out because we like Earth Day, Earth Day is our thing. We go to the parades and stuff. So we like to keep the streets clean.", "1733": "I want to triple down on that point. That's a good point. And Kimberly. Kimberly, if you're talking, you're muted-out as well.", "1734": "Sorry. I think that something that kind of stood out for me was what Wesley mentioned, because I consider New York is like [inaudible] of the world. Everyone knows that everyone comes to New York, and even though New York is very well-known, some of the boroughs, they don't have the same care. For example, we already mentioned the streets are very, some communities don't have the ability to go to the stores, markets that have what they need. We don't have the same resources as others. And also the homeless, I think there is a lot of homeless outside in the train, and I think that's something that we have to work on.", "1735": "Absolutely. Thank you, everybody, again for your input. Do you have any questions for us? Because those were pretty much all the questions that we had for you, or any other closing thoughts you would like to share or any other general reflections on the conversation?", "1736": "I would like to share something. Yule, thank you for helping facilitate this conversation. Something I've become a lot more passionate about and a lot more informed is the reality of dismantling police departments. And that's something I'm seeing in Minneapolis, and I think they're going to do. And nine council members have agreed to dismantle the police department and to rebuild a safer and more community-based approach to public safety. So I looked at examples of in Camden, New Jersey, and I do think that's something that, in terms of health, I think that New York City police can really contribute to the health of the community instead of kind of brutalizing communities.", "1737": "Thank you for that. Anyone else? All right. Again, thank you for joining. Just a reminder of what will happen with the thoughts you just shared, the recordings will be transcribed, indexed and eventually shared-out with journalists, public officials and participants in the Local Voices Network.

Hillary and Delaney, do you agree? Please say, \"Aye.\" All right, thank you, Hillary. Delaney, do you agree? Are you there, Delaney? Sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name.", "1753": "Yeah, sorry, I was getting something to drink.", "1754": "Thank you. All right, so let's get started. So first we're going to start off with introductions and getting to know one another, so I would like you to start off with your first name and please share a little bit of your background information, like where do you live or what you do, and a value that is important to you and how it relates to what brought you here today. So I can start. My name is Kelly, as you know. I am originally from Lower East Side. I currently live in the Bronx. I work in Brooklyn. And for those of you who don't know, I oversee our Brooklyn youth programs.", "1755": "And a value that is important to me today is respect, and when talking about health in our communities, I think it's a basic right for our communities to have access to the best resources. And I just think that it's disrespectful when there's disparities in our communities, so I think when I talk about health, I think about respect. It's just basic. Everyone doesn't have to love each other, but I think that everyone needs to respect each other. Anyone can go next.", "1756": "Hi, my name is Delani. I live in Brooklyn. What else did you ask?", "1757": "The questions are a little bit about yourself or where do you live, what you do, and then a value that is important to you and how is it related to what brought you here today?", "1758": "Okay. I am a peer educator with PSOL A value would be helping others. I value that because helping others is very important. It helps you grow as a person. And it also helps you help somebody else who needs to help, you know? Yeah.", "1759": "Thank you.", "1760": "Of course.", "1761": "My name is Hillary. I am also from PSOL, Project Speak Out Loud. I'm from the Bronx, and something that... Wait, what was the question? I'm so sorry. Something I value, right?", "1762": "Yes, so a value that is important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today.", "1763": "Okay, a value that's important to me is communication, and that brought me here today because we're communicating all of us as a whole about things that are going on today. I feel like communication really helps others to get to hear other people's opinion and how they're feeling. So I guess, yeah.", "1764": "Thank you.", "1765": "You're welcome.", "1766": "Hi, everyone. I'm [Yamilex 00:05:38], [Yami] for short. I'm from Brooklyn. I've lived here all my life. I work in the Lower East Side from Grand Street Settlement, a nonprofit organization, particularly in youth services. And what brings me here today is I love to give back to the community in any way that I can, so if I can be a voice and learn any helpful methods in terms of health and for our community, then that'll be great.", "1767": "Thank you, [Yami 00:06:10].", "1768": "My name is Felicity. I'm an AmeriCorps member. And one of the values that really stand out to me is integrity. I am a third year nursing student as well, so for me it's all about giving back to my community, but also being part of a bigger change, especially as a minority, and seeing the healthcare that we get and the difference amongst different communities. So for me, it's really important that we be honest with one another and our voices be heard, and just getting involved in being a change.", "1769": "Thank you.", "1770": "My name is Brian. I love in Washington Heights, Manhattan. I'm an AmeriCorps member, and you said something that means a lot to me, right?", "1771": "Yeah, a value that's important to you.", "1772": "A value that's important to me. I would say accountability, because I think accountability matters in terms of growing as a person, knowing when you're wrong and knowing when you're right. So in order to move onto the next step.", "1773": "Thank you, Brian.", "1774": "No problem.", "1775": "I also wanted to add one more thing, I'm sorry. I am currently in school, so I will have to be leaving at around 6:00. So I'll just stick around for what I can.", "1776": "Thank you. Emily and Hannah?", "1777": "Sorry, my name is Hannah. I'm AmeriCorps program director. Glad to be here. Are we choosing a word?", "1778": "Yeah, so share a value that is important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today.", "1779": "And how it's related to what? I'm sorry.", "1780": "To what brought you here today.", "1781": "Oh. I would say integrity, and I feel like integrity is being truthful to who you are and I think being a part of the Team Town Hall and being here and watching young people grow and get poured into and get educated is a huge thing for me. So I get a lot of joy and excitement from seeing that actually happen before my eyes. Yeah.", "1782": "That's awesome. Thank you, Hannah. Emily, you're up next.", "1783": "Emily, you want to read what's in the chat for us?", "1784": "Oh, I can read it. So my name is Emily, I'm from Brooklyn. I'm an AmeriCorps member. Something that I value speaking up and standing up for what's right. Yes, Emily, thank you for that. So this introductory piece that we did here is going to help guide our conversation. It's going to be the order in which we take turns to answer questions. So here's the order that we're going to follow for the questions that we have coming up. And then we can see midway whether or not the order's working for us or if people just want to do popcorn style. But for the next question, let's follow the order that I put in the chat.", "1785": "So the next thing we like to do is share a little bit about ourselves. So I want you all to think of a time, a place, or a story where you felt you were the best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, or what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at the team and how do you feel? So close your eyes or if you remember right now, think about a time which you felt your best self when it came to health and your wellness, and what do you remember about that time? What did you do to support it? What was going on? And how did you feel? And I can start.", "1786": "I think at a time when I felt like I was my best self was when I was an undergrad and it was my senior year, and I was working on my thesis. And I was really, really stressed, and I hate going to the gym, still do, but I decided that every night after I was done writing pieces of my thesis that I was going to the gym and just work out, regardless of what time of night it was. If it was 12:00 in the morning, I was going to go to the gym. And because after I went to the gym I felt so good and looked forward to writing and cramming on my writing session just to go to the gym even though I didn't like it.", "1787": "And my senior year, if you've heard of the freshman 15, 20, 40, I had gained a lot of weight in my college years, so doing that while I was stressed helped me maintain my weight. I felt so good that I was even trying to make better eating habits, so that was a time where I felt very, very good about myself. But then also physically I felt good.", "1788": "For me I think it would have to be when I started my senior year. At first, I was so excited about all these new activities and new things that they were telling us was going to take place during the whole entire school year. Then I just started getting stressed with the work, college-wise planning and everything. I still am kind of, but I've been trying to just take it one step at a time and see different ways to get everything done. So I won't stress myself out so much. Because I got to the point where I just didn't even want to talk to anybody. I was isolating myself, even during the pandemic, like when the pandemic started, I didn't want to talk to anybody or anything. I was like, I'm just having these mood swings and everything. So yeah.", "1789": "Thank you for sharing that.", "1790": "For me, it kind of [inaudible] senior year, so, let me see, what was this? So during my softball season, even though I didn't get to have it this year, I'm a senior, I didn't get to have it for the pandemic, but we did get two weeks in of training, and during those first two weeks of the first two weeks of March, it actually felt really good. I felt physically good and mentally good, because when you work out, I don't know, so much stress is relieved. And senior year was going great, and I was on my last softball season, so I'm going to do great. I'm going to do this. So I was in a very positive mindset. So I guess that's a time.", "1791": "Nice.", "1792": "I would say mid-sophomore year and undergrad. I was feeling my best in terms of health and wellness because I decided to take a shift in my eating habits and I actually started incorporating workouts in my schedule, and I feel like this was great for my whole structure in undergrad because I just felt like I was all over the place and adding this type of health in my life just made me feel way better, and in terms of even waking up early in the morning. I even used a social media platform to spread awareness with meal prepping and working out, and I was just sharing my lifestyle with others, trying to encourage others to do it and let them know how good it feels.", "1793": "Nice. Thank you.", "1794": "So a time that I felt my happiest and doing my best wellness-wise had to be right before this pandemic, so the beginning of my junior year. I had dealt with a lot of stress and pressure from school, and I was adjusting to a new curriculum, so it was really difficult to stay on track and be able to work out and eat as healthy as I wanted to. But over the summer, well, last summer, I actually took time to better manage my schedule, and I had gotten into it. I was going to school, I was doing my clinical sites. I became an AmeriCorps member. I was still working a full-time job and still doing community service and doing all of that seven days a week. I was still able to find time for myself. So I would go out with a bunch of my sisters and we would go for walks or we would go to the gym. We were eating better and we had a group chat and we would just motivate each other.", "1795": "Although I just feel like I didn't have the most time, I made the best of the time that I had, and it was really sad when all this came in and we had to stay indoors and not be as active physically outdoors as we wanted to be. But it's something that I plan on continuing to do as the city opens up and we get back a little to our daily lives.", "1796": "Thank you.", "1797": "For me, I would say now is when I've been feeling the healthiest. I've had nothing but time to improve myself, and I've been working out as much as I can, since I don't have to go to school anymore, I don't really have any places to be. I just spend time to improve my well-being.", "1798": "That's great, thank you, Brian.", "1799": "Thanks, Brian. I guess I would have said that I was my healthiest in high school when I was on the swim team, but I realized back then I was, even though I was working out, I was still eating a lot of junk. So I would say I felt my healthiest maybe three weeks ago. Working out and eating a lot of greens and things like that. I'm still eating well, but I'm not working out as much as I used to because I'm focused a lot on work, so I'm trying to get back to a place where I'm able to manage my time properly and fit in some time for physical activity. Yeah.", "1800": "Thank you, Hannah. And Emily, thank you for sharing in the chat. That's beautiful. So she said, \"A time where I felt my happiest would be every day I spend with my brother, because he makes me look at life at a different perspective.\" And yeah, being happy contributes to health, right? That's your mental health. And when your mental health is great, then you can do so many things physically as well. So thank you for bringing that up, because health is physical, it's mental, emotional, and I'm very happy to hear that your brother makes you that happy. Thank you for sharing that. And thank you all for sharing.", "1801": "Yeah, a lot of what I heard from you guys is you felt your healthiest because you were motivated. Some of you shared, [Yami] lectured motivating others to get healthy, finding time in your schedule, changing your perspective on how you saw your schedule went about your day to day helped you feel your healthiest. Being involved in sports and having habits and routines made you feel healthiest. So now when I ask the next question, I want you to think about a broader sense of health in your community. And it doesn't have to be your community where you live, but your community of people that you can relate to, that resonate with you. So as I mentioned, for the purposes of the conversation, we're going to think broadly about community and share either about your neighborhood community or your social community, and when you're responding to the questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you're thinking about when you share that story.", "1802": "I have a couple of questions to start off. But we hope that at this time, there can be some back and forth dialogue by everyone. If something comes to mind, feel free to chime in after somebody responds. That's okay. So the next question is, what in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? And what are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better. So I'll repeat it again. What in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places, or things that positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Share a story from your experience that helps us understand a little bit better.", "1803": "So when I was asked this question in a training that I did, I live in the Bronx, and the Bronx doesn't have a lot of healthy food options or a lot of outdoor spaces that support with health and well-being. So I was having a really hard time thinking about my immediate community where I live. But when I thought broader about community, one of my communities is Brooklyn and the work that we do in Brooklyn. And I thought about our community centers, and how our cornerstone programs contribute positively to the communities that we serve, because at our cornerstone programs, kids do recreation. Kids get support and guidance from the staff for their mental health. But then also, when those communities are going through a challenge, for example, right now, a lot of our cornerstone community centers are doing food distribution to families in need, right?", "1804": "So that's something that supports the health of the communities in which I work for. So when I think about supporting the well-being of communities and positive story, it comes from the places where I work, not necessarily where I live. So again, when you think about community and well-being of communities, it doesn't only have to be your immediate neighborhood. It could be New York City as a whole. It could be a sector of New York City. So I hope that clarifies and helps you think broader about the question. I'm going to say it again. What in your community's working well to support your health and well-being, and what are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Anyone can start. We don't have to keep with the timeline.", "1805": "Great, I'll go. Kelly, I guess I would echo what you're saying. I feel like there's a lot that's working within our community at Grand Street Settlement. I feel like as an AmeriCorps program director, I meet with my AmeriCorps members twice a week, and just in a great environment to continue communicating with them. I feel like it's a good help, when I think about health, talking specifically about mental health, and that's been very helpful to be a part of that community. And I would say also my church community. That has really helped with my mental health, and I do something called... Well, my church does something called dinner parties, where we meet every week. Before quarantine, we would meet at a friend's house. There's probably 50 all across New York City. And that was very helpful to me.", "1806": "And now we do it virtually, so that's my way of still being able to hang out with friends, still be present, and not feel so isolated.", "1807": "That's great.", "1808": "Okay, I'll go. I'll say one thing that helps me personally with my well-being is I like how I have a girls group, a couple of my friends and I, and although we don't always get to see each other, we usually check up on each other and just have beneficial conversations that's good for our mental health, I feel like is a good thing, where we just always communicating, open up, and always just vent to someone. I feel like there's always a voice that needs to be heard, and if you can help [inaudible 00:24:04]. If you feel like you're going to be given the words that you need to hear, I feel like then that's a great thing.", "1809": "And then in terms for my community, I work in the Lower East Side, as I had previously mentioned. There was just a day where I... I usually open on most days. [inaudible] offering, saying that he can give a lot of resources. So that kind of gave me an idea that I would like to have healthcare, because I do know that in the community, a lot of the parents need mental health services in terms of speaking. They always like to speak to have support. So [inaudible] and plan the health care [inaudible] but I just feel like that would be beneficial [inaudible] so that they can be aware of all the free services or [inaudible] services in terms of going to medicals for checkups, and just even to have someone to speak to.", "1810": "That's awesome, thank you. Anyone else want to share about this question? When you think about helping your community, let's say what foods are available in your community, are there hospitals in your community, are there clinics in your community? Are health events taking place in your community? Does anything come to mind when I mention that set to you guys?", "1811": "I think I can speak on the food. So having access to resources in a way, so again, I live in Brooklyn, and I guess we were very fortunate during this pandemic that a lot of our local food stands actually remain open, so we can go out and get a lot of this fresh produce. As I've discovered that a lot of times I wouldn't... My first choice would not be to go to a big supermarket to get my fresh produce, one, because I feel like they're more costly, and secondly, because I don't feel that they're the same quality. I feel that they'll expire a little bit quicker on me, and I won't be able to use them. But I guess in my area in Brooklyn, I was very fortunate to have access to healthier food options, and better cost effective.", "1812": "And within my community, I must say that there's quite a handful of hospitals near me. And throughout this pandemic, I know that they were very busy, even just passing by, but I know that in Sunset and in Bay Ridge, there are a lot of now testing sites, where there's actually stations outside and you can register beforehand. You can go in and either get the antibody test done or the actual COVID to see if you currently have it. So now that I'm going out, it's kind of nice to see that the community is respecting one another's space, but I guess respecting the community as a whole. But I guess we're also very fortunate just to have these resources to just lean on as a whole.", "1813": "Thank you, Felicity. Does anyone have anything else to add? Okay. So I'm going to go into the next question, which Felicity has guided us into. So the next question is, what are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better. So I can go first. Like I said, I live in the Bronx, and the Bronx has the highest number of people who tested positive for COVID, and now the highest number of deaths, and still there's hot pockets of communities in the Bronx that have a 50% rate of people who have gotten COVID.", "1814": "What I noticed is that like many things that happen in communities of color, either because of a lack of information being disseminated to these communities, meaning the language barriers that exist, the technology barriers that exist in these types of communities, and then also people's comfort. Are people willing to listen to the information that's out there, because they come from a different background, like an immigrant background? And sometimes when, me speaking from an immigrant background, being Dominican, oftentimes I know that in the Dominican culture, like many things, the government handles that. Drop off your kids at school, the school handles that. The principal's going to manage that. When the kid is at my house, I manage it. And I feel like that mentality transcends into situations that happen that affects multiple communities, that sometimes people don't fully understand or believe what's going on, and the feel like it doesn't pertain to them. It's not their responsibility.", "1815": "I also think because people who are black and brown in poor communities have to work. That's something that also has impacted I feel the high numbers where either people don't have the right information, or they feel like they're invincible to what's going on, or because of the need, they must work. They must go in to do the work to get paid for their family's survival. So I think when I continue to hear about the rising numbers or that there's hot pockets, all of the majority of the city has flat lined, I ask myself why? And those are the rationales that I come up with, and it makes me sad, because there's lots of work that continues to need to be done, specifically in black and brown communities, and a lot of it stems from lack of resources, disconnection with communication, outreach, and then also because of need.", "1816": "Kelly, can you reiterate the question that you were asking?", "1817": "Yeah. So what are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Maybe it would help for you guys to think about where you live. How have the people where you live responded to the pandemic? What does it feel like? What does it look like? What's going on in your community in regards to the pandemic?", "1818": "Well, in my community, there's a little bit of both. There's a half people that do care, and half people that don't care about what's going on. Those people that are going back to work and helping others, they're just people who risk their lives every day, so they care of others in the hospital or clinics, and these others that are still hanging out in groups and just not wearing masks, not keeping their distance. You can hang out, but there's a certain distance, and just have your mask on. So if I look at my window, there's a good three groups just standing there and talking to each other. So I guess no, it's a little bit of both taking place.", "1819": "Yeah, I agree with Hillary, too. My community is very much so tight knit community. Everybody's usually out on the streets talking to one another, especially neighbors. There are a lot of black home ownership in my neighborhood, so a lot of the people, we all know each other, so we're constantly on the streets. And from what it seems like, it seems like a lot of the people in this neighborhood have essential jobs, too. So a lot of them are out. I feel like the older ones are usually home. But I feel like my community in Flatbush has not stopped running. It's still going. Yeah. It doesn't feel like there was one moment where everyone was inside. But yeah, I still feel like it's very resilient.", "1820": "People are able to transform. They're able to pivot. You have even people selling things out on the street. I'm sure they're going through things, but it seems like they almost use this as an opportunity to be able to make money in a different way. And honestly, I see that as an entrepreneurial skill. They're selling masks and doing a bunch of other things, so yeah, they're still going. They're still moving. It's like the city that never sleeps, right in Flatbush. Yeah.", "1821": "Thank you, Hannah.", "1822": "Thank you.", "1823": "I kind of agree with Hannah. In my neighborhood, I have seen the entrepreneurial skills improving a bit. I will say that before the pandemic, I feel like my community was a type of people to leave certain situation or things in the hands of others, and now during the pandemic, I feel like communication is improving for the better. Everyone seems more united, in a sense, and let's say when I'm walking into my building, I see people have posters up, not to help out others, and [inaudible] they can be things like oh, healthcare, since we do have essential workers. So I guess I can say that [inaudible] speaking more to each other and helping each other out more. I definitely feel like it shouldn't have taken a pandemic for things to improve in this way, but I still appreciate that everyone's doing [inaudible] community.", "1824": "Thank you, [Yamilex 00:35:02]. Anyone else want to share? All right. Yeah, what I'm hearing is that people have kept on with their lives because of resiliency, because they're essential workers, because there is need. People have been able to tap into skills that didn't probably have the time to tap into. People are united. They continue to unite and to have communication. And as Hillary mentioned, there are some people that just want to be around each other during this time, and I see that a lot, too, in my community as well. Not necessarily because they're essential workers, but people have the urge to be around one another. Thank you for sharing, all of you guys.", "1825": "My next question is, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like, and what would it feel like? One thing that comes to mind for me is where everyone can have access to the best quality food, where I wouldn't have to go to Whole Foods 30 minutes away driving to get organic, fresh food, or go down to the Lower East Side to Trader Joe's to get good, quality food, where I would envision communities would have supermarkets where quality food could be found or farmer's markets where quality produce could be found easily accessible within every community. That's what I would imagine.", "1826": "Yeah, I would agree with that, because I feel like that leads to everything else. I guess I would have said, yeah, quality healthcare as well for the community. But I feel like before even the healthcare, it is access to food. There's a quote that I heard of that goes like this, \"Let thy food by thy medicine.\" And when you do eat the right foods, it does lead to better health for your body. So yeah, so I would agree with that, Kelly. Better access to healthy foods, and quality, but affordable foods, and then universal healthcare.", "1827": "Yes. Universal healthcare would be amazing.", "1828": "Yes.", "1829": "Thank you, Hannah.", "1830": "I want to add onto the universal healthcare. I feel like that's a very essential one, and it's great now that I'm seeing more Urgent Cares or little facilities instead of just having to take transportation to your nearest hospital, which can be far. So I like that idea.", "1831": "Thank you, [Yamilex 00:38:13]. So yeah, you're noticing more clinics, smaller clinics in various communities showing up. More access to healthcare.", "1832": "I definitely agree with the access to healthcare. And I'm also all for making it more affordable, because firsthand seeing it even, I think it's a great idea they're opening up more clinics so there's more accessibility. But even with saying from internally looking from the other side, there's still a lot of people that are scared to come into these clinics because a copayment is sometimes double, triple what you would pay just to see your regular doctor. And sometimes the burden of... So let's say I'm in a community where there aren't as many clinics. So you have more of a choice not to call an ambulance to pick you up. The fee of the ambulance just to transport you alone is enough to worry someone. I'm going to put that burden.", "1833": "So definitely making healthcare more affordable, because it's great that we can all have healthcare, but they also have to consider that we all can afford the same price for certain things, so it has to be affordable, too.", "1834": "Thank you, Felicity. What about like people who take the train? Conditions on our trains, or conditions in our streets? Cleanliness of our streets contribute to health. Our parks and having more green spaces, and air quality, all these things contribute to our health. Are there any thoughts around that?", "1835": "Yeah. I think that's a big deal, too. That's actually one of the issues that I want to see change in my own community of Flatbush, because it is so busy. It's so busy, but they wouldn't pay much attention to this area as they would, say, for instance, 42nd Street or Tribeca or whatever. So I think there needs to be a fair distribution of sanitation trucks everywhere, to all communities, and not just focus in one community. So I feel like in a sense, there's an injustice in that. Communities like mine or other parts of Brooklyn would have a huge concentration of police officers while we wouldn't have a huge concentration of sanitation workers that would help make the air cleaner.", "1836": "So yeah, it's a little bit annoying, but I feel like there's a lot that needs to be done in these type of spaces in order to, I don't know, meet needs, I guess.", "1837": "Yeah. Thank you for that, Hannah. And [Yamilex 00:41:35], I saw your input into the chat, thank you for joining and have a good class. And I have a question for those of you who are in school, either you're in college or you're a senior in high school or still in high school, thinking about what would make New York City feel or be healthy, I would like to ask, when you go back to school, what would make your school feel healthy to you or feel safe and healthy to you? Can you think about that and share what would that look like after having lived through this pandemic? What would you think that your school would need to do in order for you to feel healthy while you're there?", "1838": "I guess I can speak on it. I wouldn't have more things that my school community could do better, because I feel like they're very proactive when it comes to making our campus feel at home and a place that we're proud to call home, I guess I want to say. Even before this whole pandemic when there was speculations that it was arriving here to our city, they already were cleaning, there was already hand sanitizer stations put in place, but I guess their continuation of ensuring that the classrooms are clean, because I know for me, and my class sizes are already pretty small and so are our classrooms. So I wouldn't be too worried about that, but I would just be more concerned that they're going to continue and carry it out and make sure that they're cleaning and taking proper precautions.", "1839": "And definitely, there is actually one thing, now that I say that. The dining facility, so we have two main dining facilities, and it worries me a little bit because we do have a lot of residents on campus. So we're pretty busy throughout the day, so I don't really see how it's going to play out where we're all... Because we all eat almost at the same time. So I definitely think that they're going to have to think that through, probably whether it's adding food trucks or designating certain little time areas, just to make sure that we can still, not just be nutritious, but get the nutrients that we need throughout the day. So that's something that they're definitely going to have to work on.", "1840": "Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. I agree. The way we would go about our normal day to day after having lived through a pandemic makes us put in question to ask what will things look like when we return back to our regular lives? Brian, Hillary, Emily, Delani, do you want to share anything about my question?", "1841": "I was kind of going to bounce off of what Felicity said, but for different reasons kind of sort of. Me personally, the only [inaudible] to make my school feel safer in the clean sense is maybe if they spread out the students more or even cleaned more frequently. But if I were to go to my high school again for another year, if I wasn't graduating this year, it's already as small as it is, and there aren't many students. So I don't think there's much that could be done. Me personally, I was cool with the staff in my school and I know they clean every day [inaudible] should have been doing. Maybe I guess, to add the suggestion, maybe, I don't know, take extra precautions and go above and beyond, making sure that the area is safe.", "1842": "Yeah. I think about that a lot, too. What will schools look like, because space is hard already in school, so what would that look like? And I wanted to pose that question to you all, because when we're in school, we spend the majority of our lives in those spaces as a student. So that contributes to our health as well, and I know that then I was younger in elementary school, I would complain about the lunch. And now school foods made changes to the menu to be healthier and also to be more inclusive of different cultures. That's something that when I was a kid didn't exist, and I know that the Department of Education made a big push to get healthier options, but then also to consider what other cultures liked and also to expose other students to other people's cuisines. Anyone want to add anything? Okay.", "1843": "So the next question that I have is, what is one thing you heard today that you will be taking away from this conversation that you'd like other people to hear? So I'm going to stick to the outline that we had initially, so we'll start off with Delani, and then we'll go to Hillary, Felicity, Brian, Hannah, and Emily. So the question is, what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation that you'd like other people to hear? And I can start. One thing that was an ah-ha moment was hearing Hannah and [Yamilex] talk about people becoming entrepreneurial during this time and tapping into their skills to sustain themselves, but then also to pursue passion, I would imagine. And that's something that's a positive through this tough experience that our city lives.", "1844": "Yeah, I agree with you. I have to say, hearing how people are handling the pandemic and everything and what they are doing to continue life as they were kind of.", "1845": "Thank you.", "1846": "I would say it adds onto what you guys are saying, but the pandemic, making sure their mental health and physical health is still the same. Just because we're home doesn't mean, like you said, you would work out after doing your thesis statements and stuff like that. So some of us are still taking classes, so we could try that out, and also just reflect on our day to keep our mental health same.", "1847": "Yeah. Absolutely.", "1848": "The biggest takeaway for me was realizing the importance of communication, because a lot of people, we don't know what their lives are like when they're home on a daily basis, especially for a lot of students. We don't know what they're really experiencing. So checking in with them and making sure that everything's okay and just having someone to talk to, because we really don't know what people are going through, so just doing little check-ins.", "1849": "Absolutely. That's great.", "1850": "For me, I'll say that hearing that people are actually keeping up with their well-being and improving themselves, and also that other communities are actually caring about their fellow citizens and keeping them accountable.", "1851": "Thank you.", "1852": "I guess my takeaway would be affordable food and healthcare. I think that is a necessity. I think America is... I think it's just only America and then one other country in Africa that doesn't have affordable healthcare, which is, I mean, not affordable, sorry, universal healthcare, which is reckless. It makes no sense, and I feel like it's kind of driving us into a hole, so yeah. Leaving from this conversation, I would want people to I guess know about the importance of that. [crosstalk] How would this affect us as a community. Yeah.", "1853": "Perfect. And Emily, thank you for writing in the chat. She said, \"One thing that I loved to hear was everyone talking about a time they felt the happiest because mental and emotional also physical is really important.\" Absolutely. And everything we mentioned here contributes to our well-being. My final question will be, does anyone have any final thoughts that they want to share, reflections, or have any questions for me about what we discussed in this group?", "1854": "No, I'll just say thank you.", "1855": "Yeah, thank you all for engaging in these questions. I know it's not something we talk about every day. But I do hope that after today's conversation, when you walk outside, you start asking questions about why is this this way? And how is this supporting or going against my health? Or how can I get involved to enhance the health of my communities? Or what clinics exist, what programs exist, and how are they contributing to the health of my communities? I hope that when you step out today or tomorrow that you start thinking in this way, having lived through a pandemic, which I never thought we would live in our lifetimes. I think this conversation helps us have that lens when we step out whenever we do next time around.", "1856": "So thank you all. We are going to go back into the main group and close out. So we can leave the room now, if you go to the leave room button. It'll take you back to the main group, and then we'll close out.", "1857": "Thank you.", "1858": "Thank you.", "1859": "Hey. Hi, Kelly.", "1860": "Hey.", "1861": "Welcome back.", "1862": "Yes. We have one more group to come back.", "1863": "Yep.", "1864": "Excellent.", "1865": "I've got one more person in the breakout room, too. In your room. And Alex should be wrapping up her conversation now. I don't know if you can see the survey that I just posted, but I'll post it again so everyone else that just joined us from breakout room two can take the survey.", "1866": "Perfect.", "1867": "Here we go. How'd it go?", "1868": "Very well.", "1869": "Awesome.", "1870": "Is that everyone, Yule?", "1871": "No. Alex's group is not done with their conversation yet.", "1872": "Okay.", "1873": "So they should be done shortly. I just messaged her as well.", "1874": "Okay. So everyone that's on now, if you take a couple of minutes to complete the survey that Yule put in the chat box, that would be great.", "1875": "And there she is.", "1876": "All right. Welcome back, everyone. I hope you enjoyed your conversations. There is a survey in the chat box that I want to make a plug for everyone to complete. It takes two minutes. So please take some time to complete that either now or before you close out your computer after this call. So I do want to wrap up and thank everyone for joining this conversation today. I know this has been different in comparison to other Town Halls. We usually have a guest speaker. But I am very happy to see so many of you who got on, that I see week after week and that we were able to have these conversations. And for me and my group, I think the takeaway was now when we step out into the world, step out onto our blocks, take the train, or go into the workplace, we start thinking the lens about health and what contributes to the health of ourselves as individuals, but then our communities, right?", "1877": "Like what do the organizations in your community do to contribute and to support to the health of your community? What do you do as an individual to support the health of your community in a positive way or in a negative way, and how can you become involved, if that's something that you want to do? So with that being something that was top of mind for myself, I want to invite any of you to share some closing remarks on your experience today, anything that stood out, feel free to unmute yourself and share. Or you can put it in the chat box.", "1878": "I'll share that in, shout out to breakout room number three, a lot of conversations were started in there, everything from implementing mindfulness into our communities, really having a community-based approach to the problems in the community, whether that's an environmental problem or a lack of access to quality healthcare, quality food. So I was really inspired by a lot of the conversations we had. Thank you.", "1879": "Thank you.", "1880": "I want to say the same. I felt like we talked a lot about how we would like New York City to be today, but it was a really important conversation that we should be having, and I felt really inspired to also want to do something in my own way to help New York City.", "1881": "Thank you. [inaudible]", "1882": "I'll speak. I think it was in our break room, I feel like one of the words I've been saying is impact, that being away from our kids and students, that a lot of them are being affected heavily, and we don't always get to see... We're not able to see how they're reacting towards everything within every moment. So by them reaching out to us, it really shows that they really care, and that they really want to still feel connected to us as well, even though we're not with them.", "1883": "Yeah, thank you, Barbara. Yeah. Something that came up in my group as well is communication and community, and supporting one another through hard times positively impacts your well-being and your health and supports your mental health and how so much joy and happiness comes from supporting one another, and some people also talked about seeing your community rise up and strengthen their communication and becoming entrepreneurs and looking out for one another and sharing resources during this time. Those are some of the positive ways that my group shared out that the pandemic has impact their communities. All right. Yule and Alex, is there anything else that should be sharing out?", "1884": "No, just a huge, heartfelt thank you to all of you for sharing so much of yourselves today and again, just to reiterate that this will be used, so that's kind of an exciting thing to think about, that all of the ideas and experiences that you brought with you today, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will be listening to those to think about what healthy communities around New York City look like. So we're excited about that, and we'll share the results back with you as well. We want to give you the opportunity to listen to all of these conversations that have been recorded with 15 other community partners as well, so thank you so much. Thank you, Kelly.", "1885": "Thank you, Alex.", "1886": "Yeah, again, just to second everything Alex is saying, I enjoyed the conversation as well. I didn't get to hear the other two, but my conversation with us was great, and I got invited to a block party, so that's awesome. Yeah, so again, thank you, everybody, for taking the time, and we really, really, truly appreciate your input.", "1887": "Yes, thank you both for joining and facilitating at the last minute. I really enjoyed this experience, and thank you to the youth, thank you for allowing us to ask questions and thank you for not being afraid for sharing. Thank you to my team, my colleagues who are on this call. Your work does not go unnoticed, and I could not do this with the people who coordinate the weekly Town Hall meetings, you know who you are, thank you for helping supporting me to make this happen, and for our youth, continue to join our weekly Town Halls next Wednesday. We resume with a guest speaker. These conversations had lots of value and will have impact in what goes on in New York City, so thank you for not being afraid.", "1888": "And also another plug, once again, copy the link for the survey and make sure you take it before you shut down your technology. The [inaudible] will be really appreciated, and that's all, folks. Have a good evening. Take care. And be easy.", "1889": "Thank you, everyone. Take care.", "1890": "Bye, everyone.", "1891": "Have a good one. Be safe.", "1892": "Alrighty. Continue. Alrighty, everyone. Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I've begun recording at this time, and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded, the video will be discarded, and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes of this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another.", "1893": "Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and the needs of the community to candidates, local policy members, and members of the media. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different set of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our position on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and well-being of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information.", "1894": "This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversation in communities and the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation, and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website or be broadcast on the local radio station or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media, so please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public.", "1895": "If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree,\" or shake your head.", "1896": "I agree.", "1897": "I now pronounce you... Alrighty, let's see. So that's pretty much everyone. Super. And I want to have a good time. I know I'm reading off a script, but if you know me, I'm very silly. I like to have a great time with everyone. It allows us to be more comfortable and authentic and organic, so that's an experience I want to share and have with everyone today. Alrighty. Super. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to share and to learn from others in this conversation, and to support the goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversations, also on the materials we sent with your confirmation emails. Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns.", "1898": "Stay curious. Take time to reflect. Pause, take time for reflection. Listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. When possible, close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. If everyone is on board with these guidelines, is there anything you would like to add or change? Everyone's cool? Let me turn off that notification. I'm sorry. Work. Super. Alrighty. For the ease of the virtual conversation, we are going to use a modified survey process where each person will take a turn, and posting that order in which we will be invited to respond in the chat box helps transition us from one person to the next. You can always pass or pass and ask for us to come back to you.", "1899": "So it's going to be Shosanna, Joelle, Nick, Lilian. But I first will also demonstrate a response to the question, just so we get an insight of exactly how it's going to go. Alrighty. To begin, we want to do a quick run of introductions. Please share just your first name or pseudonym. In addition to your first name, please share a little bit of background information about who you are, where you live, or what do you do, and a value that is important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today. For this round, I'll start.", "1900": "Hi. So my name is Mike. My friends call me Mikey. I recently moved to Pelham Bay, which is in the Bronx. I live across New York City in all the boroughs. I grew up in Queens, in Bellerose, Queens, a little suburban area, and I'm going to be 40 this year. So I'm excited about that. I'm from Caribbean descent. I'm Guyanese and Syrian. And preferred gender pronouns are he and his, and a value that is very important to me today is authenticity. I feel being organic and true to who you are is something that will be good in this conversation in a way of [inaudible 00:06:37]. All right. So the first person that will be going up is Shosanna.", "1901": "Hi, everybody, I'm Shosanna. Can you hear me? Yeah? Okay. I'm 25 years old. I live in Hollis, Queens. I've been here for the last, I think 17 years now. It feels like forever. I work with the Department of Design and Construction, so it's really cool, and I thought doing this with our Mental Health and Hygiene, right, would be nice to see the health side of things and to actually engage in a conversation, because I don't really engage in these types of conversations. So I thought it'd be nice to step outside of my comfort zone. I'm Guyanese, even though people say I look Spanish or Polynesian, I'm like, \"No, guys, I'm Guyanese.\" Did I miss anything?", "1902": "Oh, and value. Something I've been actually stressing about lately is honesty. I find that a lot of people in my close circle have been lying to me and makes me feel so uncomfortable, and I feel like I'm in this weird funk right now. So one for me is honesty. Keep it 100%.", "1903": "That's great. Well, hi. Thank you, Shosanna. Next we have Joelle. Is it Joelle or Joel?", "1904": "Joelle. Yeah. It's Joelle. Yeah. A pleasure to meet everyone. I'm actually not so far away from Mikey. I'm staying with my boyfriend in the Bronx. He lives in Castle Hill, so not too far from Pelham Bay, so super close. [crosstalk] Yeah, let's do it. Pronouns are he, him, his, and I was really interested in participating in this conversation, Mikey, because I work at the Ford Foundation. It's a social justice organization, and I work in HR, but I also lead our disability employee resource group, and so a lot of the discussions that we have are around how people in the disability community, specifically our employees, but just how people in general are experiencing health, what it means to care for people who are either disabled or able-bodied, and so this conversation in particular was really interesting for me.", "1905": "In terms of value, one of the things that I always like to mention is humility. I always like to act with a sense of humility, but also assume that everyone has the best of intentions, although we live in a world where that probably isn't the case, but I always like to operate from that viewpoint. So that's a value that I value.", "1906": "Thanks, Joelle.", "1907": "Yeah.", "1908": "Nick?", "1909": "Hey, everybody. My name is Nicholas, please feel more than free to call me Nick, as that's what all my friends call me. I work in education, so I'm an elementary school teacher. I started off in arts education, and this upcoming September I will be teaching kindergarten, so I'm super excited about that and the changes that are happening in E-learning. With that being said, I really value education. I find that oftentimes the best way to combat a lot of things in the world right now is educating yourself, and that's what led me to this call, to educate myself on what's going on in mental health and things that surround that. My pronouns are he and him, and I was born and raised in Riverdale, New York, which is in the Bronx actually, it's like the last county in the Bronx. I moved to Queens not too long ago with my family, and then I moved out again and I'm back in Westchester, so. Yeah. Did I get everything there or did I miss something?", "1910": "I said, from Westchester.", "1911": "Good, Nick, thank you. Lilian?", "1912": "Hey, everyone. My name is Lilian and my gender pronouns are she, her. I was invited to the conversation, didn't know much about it, but it seemed interesting. I always like having conversations specifically about mental health in the community. I am Hispanic and black, and I feel like we don't talk about mental health. It's such a terrible stigma in our community. And I work with [inaudible] homeless adults with mental illness. I've been doing that for the past six years in a nonprofit organization, and it's so difficult to have the conversations with our clients, but I really don't like the martyrdom that comes with explaining the work that I do. I'm not a good person because I do the work I do. I do the work I do because I think that this community needs assistance and needs help, and we need to be a little bit more open about giving a hand to people who need it.", "1913": "And the systems that are in place are not very easy to navigate. I'm sorry, you can never navigate [inaudible] system to get any type of co-benefit [inaudible 00:11:46], and that burden [inaudible 00:11:47]. And something that I value, like Nicholas had mentioned, education. It wasn't really... I was the first person in my family to go to college, and I feel like you should always keep educating yourself. Always look for multiple points of view, multiple sources of information and create your own opinion. So I really appreciate [inaudible 00:12:17].", "1914": "Wow. That was fantastic learning about everyone's values, your current professions. I love seeing young people of color doing their thing, making changes in their life, the communities that they serve. Yay. That's fantastic. This brings me such joy. Super. Alrighty. So for the next thing we would like to do invite you all to share a little bit about yourself. Since we'll be talking about health and well-being today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and well-being looks like and feel like to you? So I'll let that simmer for a little bit. Next, think of the time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? And what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel?", "1915": "We'll start there. So we'll start going around one at a time, just share our stories. Please remember, this is being recorded, so we ask you not to spill any sensitive, personal information, or use the names of other people when telling your stories. So I'll start. I felt healthiest in my life when I've had to say it was in my 20s in the sense that my neck and back and knees didn't hurt. Honestly, because I've always been active and athletic, so right now, it's just like, it's the song, my neck, my back... So everything seems to hurt. And I felt like I've always all my life had access to healthcare and always having essential providers whenever I needed it, so currently now with this whole pandemic and what's going on, having direct access to healthcare is kind of sucky for me, because I damaged my knee and I just got an MRI, but I never got to actually see an orthopedic doctor in the office to review [inaudible] or to have active care.", "1916": "So back then, outside of this pandemic, it was so much easier for me to have access to a physician, and maybe more in depth healthcare. And I felt great because I was running, I was engaging in Zumba, doing things I really enjoy, and it directly impacted my mental health because I felt fit. I love exercising. It allowed me a chance to have the physique, more what I liked, for myself. So that was a time when I felt my healthiest. Okay, so yeah. It was back when I was younger. I had access to healthcare, and it made me feel great. It affected my mood and mental health. So next, we will go to Shosanna.", "1917": "Hey again. When I felt the best, I have to say was my freshman year of college, before I put on, like, 50 pounds. And I just felt so great. It was being at university was a breath of fresh air from the high school that I did go to. It was very divided amongst the races. It was just constant fighting, bickering. It was just full of drama, and I always felt uncomfortable there. I felt very like I didn't want to be there all the time. So when I started school, it was nice to see that everybody was coming together under one roof, no [inaudible 00:16:20], and I felt like we were seeing each other as equals. And we all worked together to make sure we had study groups going on, how can we help each other out to make sure that we're succeeding in academics?", "1918": "That's when I actually ended up joining a sorority as well, so I found people that I felt very comfortable with, and that was a big turning point where I felt more comfortable with myself and with the people around me. In terms of healthcare, I do agree with what Mikey said, that prior to the start of the pandemic, things were much easier to get access to. You could just pop into a doctor's office and if you needed answers, you could hopefully get them then or in the week, but now things are being so pushed back. I hope that with all the changes that are going on in terms of making healthcare convenient and affordable, I would say, hopefully virtual visits is something that will continue to grow and evolve over time.", "1919": "I've been having good experiences with my neurologist because i've been having some personal things happening, and they're great. They call, they follow up with you, and I feel like I've been getting more one on one care that way than if I were to pop in at an office where they're just trying to rush me out because they want that check. So I feel like even though things are challenging during this time, I think it's a great turning point, and hopefully it is a great turning point for healthcare, and that a lot of work will be done in terms of making things accessible, affordable, and also follow up.", "1920": "The thing is, I feel like with healthcare as well, we as the individuals need a push to go check up on ourselves. And so having our professionals call us and say, \"Hey, why didn't you show up?\" They're holding you accountable. So hopefully there are virtual meetings and stuff like that, as far as they can go, because there's so many limitations that they allow us to even... It will allow us to even check up on ourselves more and to be more inclined to want to actually look into our health and be proactive.", "1921": "Super. Thank you.", "1922": "Yep.", "1923": "Alrighty, Joelle?", "1924": "Yeah, you know what, it's funny, Shosanna, because I feel like I've had a completely opposite experience, where... So I'll backtrack a little bit. I feel like I've been at my best up until the age of 25, and then after that, it's like everything is cracking and snapping. But at 26, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition called systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, so up until 25, it was just very basic yearly checkup, everything was fine, and then after 26, when I got diagnosed with that, it was like, I was seeing all the 'ologists in the book. I mean, pulmonologists, cardiologists, you name it, I had to see. And so I went from, again, one year checkups to having to see a doctor every three months.", "1925": "And so that was in 2016. Fast forward now, still having to go to the doctor's and check up, and so when COVID hit, it was a moment of panic for me. It was literally a moment of anxiety, of panic, because I went from, again, going to the doctor's and having to do routine checkups and blood work to now worrying about how was I going to get access to go to a facility to get my blood drawn? My condition is an autoimmune condition, and so I take immunosuppressants, so that means I was also... I'm at higher risk. And so that created a whole slew of anxieties for me. But yeah, it's just been an interesting rollercoaster then. So all my appointments were canceled, and so as a patient, I was hoping, \"All right, well, this'll be a great way for me to connect with my doctors more on a one on one basis,\" and I didn't get that. I wasn't getting phone calls that said, \"Hey, we rescheduled your appointment, but I realized you might be out of medication.\"", "1926": "Right before COVID hit, I was also diagnosed with a form of scoliosis, and so I had to go get an x-ray, but I couldn't. And so my doctor had just given me a prescription and I didn't get a call back, tried to call the office, but no one's there. So there's really no way for me to get in touch with anybody. And so there's just a slew of things that for me have just been complicated because of it. Luckily, I have a strong support system and so I've been able to be okay and I have enough medication, and I'm really open about that, about my disability, about the care and my experience. But it's just been all very, very interesting to say the least. And so I think that I'm on board with you, Shosanna, in that I hope that healthcare does turn and really provide more intimate conversations rather than just say, \"Hey, you're in here for 15 minutes and then get out.\"", "1927": "I really do hope that it changes, but it's been a challenge. For me, it's been really a challenge, and so I feel very fortunate and blessed, because again, I still can walk. I feel pretty okay. But I know that there are people out there who have more complicated situations than I do and don't really have that access. So it's been a mix of emotions as it relates to health and well-being during the pandemic, but I still feel very fortunate at this point. But I just wish things were a little better in terms of healthcare.", "1928": "Thanks, Joelle. Nick?", "1929": "Yeah, so kind of off of the last statement that you said, Joelle, as far as being very blessed, I have realized over the course of time during this quarantine that I have taken a lot for granted. I am someone who's always been very healthy, and I think my healthiest point hasn't really even came yet. I think I'm still constantly in evolution. I think right now is the healthiest I've ever been as far as physical health is concerned. I have been doing juice cleanses and trying these fad diets of going vegan or only eating this, so as far as nutrition is concerned, I'm living on my own now. I moved out of my parents' house in January, and so growing up in the house that I was, I had a very big family. We always had Sunday dinners and my mom would cook ever single night, these huge meals, but they weren't always necessarily the most healthy. Tasted delicious, but not always the most healthy.", "1930": "So when I moved out, I really promised myself that I was really going to take care of my body as far as nutrition was concerned. So now that I'm on my own, I'm realizing how expensive groceries are. That's a separate conversation. But in my local grocery store, I'm buying all these healthy foods. My refrigerator is half-full, but my wallet's fully empty. So I'm buying all these healthy foods, and I'm really exploring different taste pallets, so that's great as far as nutrition is concerned. But then on the flip side, my mental health has taken a bit of a hit, only because I'm so used to that very tight knit, large community. There's always cousins over, there's always something going on, to being inside my apartment all by myself.", "1931": "So it's great on one hand. In the morning, I get on my laptop and I'll talk to my students and I'll hold my classes. But then there's that dichotomy of me getting off of my Zooms and stop putting that teacher persona on where I'm always happy to okay, I watched everything on Netflix. I'm running out of ice cream. I miss my cat. What do I do now? I am fortunate that my job provides this therapy service over, I forget the name of it, I can't remember. But I have a therapist that I use over the phone. So prior to that, I never went to therapy, because I had this huge stigma around therapy. Very short bout of me going in, but I would constantly cancel appointments. I wouldn't want to go. And I really prioritized work. I'm a workaholic, so it's like my parents have instilled that Protestant work ethic of the harder you work, the more you'll get in life.", "1932": "So I would totally push my mental health aside and just work, work, work, work, work, work. And now that I'm still working equally as hard, but from the confines of I only have four walls, you know what I mean? It's been hard because I can't do as much. I can't go to these meetings. Everything's happening, so I feel like I'm not doing as much. But I'm eating healthier. I feel like I'm super healthy right now, and because I'm in my own space, it's been more conducive to me practicing the mental health practices that I want. When I was at home, it's a bit of a struggle, because you want to meditate and you want to put on your salt rock lamp or just do all these different practices, but you also don't want your family barging into your room.", "1933": "So now that I'm on my own, I've invested in yoga mats and happy lamps and a salt rock lamp and essential oils and things that really are helping me to become the person I want to become. So I'm super healthy now, as far as nutrition is concerned. I'm actively working on my mental health to get to where I want to be, and I'm excited on where this-", "1934": "It's 12:00.", "1935": "... will take me, so yeah. That's it.", "1936": "Super. Thank you, Nick. Lilian?", "1937": "Hey. [inaudible] actually have [inaudible] but I didn't start going to a therapist until last year. I was just really stressed about... But that actually isn't quite the healthiest that I've ever felt, but I really love my therapist. And similar to you, Joelle, when COVID happened, I was trying to set up appointments to [inaudible] or video chats, but I couldn't. I don't know what it was about the system, it just wasn't working. I'm really grateful that I have insurance in my job, and it was just that everything wasn't lining up, and I was very stressed out. And I'm not a good online learner. I'm not a good online worker. Working from home was a challenge for me.", "1938": "But I had some time off, I took a break, and was able to reset and now I'm in a better groove with everything. But the healthiest I actually felt was back in I think, like, 2012. I ended up getting diagnosed with a lot of food allergies. I just wasn't feeling well. I was having aches and pains and I was in my early 20s, I was like, \"I shouldn't feel like this.\" And finally my aunt was like, \"Come to my doctor's office where I work.\" And I did all these tests regarding food allergies, and I ended up having some food allergies, and it took me a really long time, from 2012 to 2015. That's how long it took me to eliminate all the things that I'm allergic to.", "1939": "Some things were easy. Like if I eat an apple, my throat will close up, so I'm not going to eat an apple. That's simple. That's easy. But [inaudible] so frustrating. I'm really grateful that I'm living in [inaudible 00:28:22], because there are so many food options here [inaudible 00:28:29]. That's not an issue for me. I have my favorite bakery, and I will go there whenever I'm feeling a little stressed out [inaudible 00:28:41]. I also, in that amount of time, and then moving forward, I was having these really negative self-talks, and part of it does come from my close family, \"Oh, you're a little big, you're plus sized, and you need to lose weight, blah, blah, blah.\" I lost a lot of weight. [inaudible] and I'm not that now. And I'm grateful for that. I am healthy. I've never had high blood pressure or high cholesterol, anything like that, even when I was at my heaviest.", "1940": "But I used to have a lot of negative [inaudible] about don't do this, don't do that, don't eat this, don't eat that. And now I'm just like, no, if you want to try it, try it. If you don't [inaudible 00:29:33]. I don't know. I'm in a better place now, and I'm glad for that. I do yoga, but I've been doing yoga for a while. I used to have insomnia when I was a teenager. I would stay up all night [inaudible] yoga. It came on at like, 5:00 in the morning, and I used to do the moves at 5:00 in the morning and then I would [inaudible] and then go to school [inaudible 00:30:09]. So I've been doing that for a while. I'm able to go out. I'm an essential worker, so I still have to go outside, so [inaudible] I think trapped in my house.", "1941": "I know that [inaudible] or anything like that, but I do have a bike and I'm taking my bike out every once in a while, just to get out of the house. Because listen, you're hanging with your cat, [inaudible] stuck in the house with this cat, she's trying to kill me. We are not friends right now.", "1942": "Yeah, I'm not friends with cat, either.", "1943": "Only Nick is the one who gets along with that cat, right? Do you have any animals, Shosanna?", "1944": "Well, I actually had some fishes back in the day. Those all died. And I had a few parakeets, and then my dad decided to experiment. He felt like they were making a lot of mess in the house, so eventually he put the cage outside. So then the birds at a point were actually, they would fly around and they would come back, and then we would bring them back inside for the night. Yeah. And then I don't know if somebody ended up capturing them, but at a point they just stopped coming back, so we lost those.", "1945": "Aw. [crosstalk]", "1946": "I was so sad. And then I had another bird, and then we gave her away because the guy that we gave her to has another bird of a similar species or whatever. So now she has a friend. But sometimes I feel like I still hear her in the house, but she's really not here. Yeah.", "1947": "That's crazy. All right. Thank you all for sharing those stories. They're great. I know sometimes sharing about health can be very vulnerable. So thank you for that, honesty will just help us navigate. All right. Next we're going to focus on the individual more of the community-focused conversations. So we want to move onto conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and well-being in your community. For the purpose of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly, and share about either your neighborhood community or your social community. When you are responding to questions, if you are speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you are thinking of when you share your story.", "1948": "Got a few questions to start us off. But we hope that this will be a time for some back and forth among you as you share your stories. I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you, and when they are made by others in the group while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. What in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "1949": "All right, I'm going to run that one more time. What in your community so working well to support your health and well-being? When we speak of community, we're speaking either of your neighborhood community or a social community that you identify with. What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. So we'll call that question A. Alrighty. So I think for my community, I will identify it as LGBTQIA+ community.", "1950": "This month is Pride Month, and a lot of people look forward to this time of year where they're able to kind of celebrate their identity publicly and outwardly and just have a great time. So when COVID happened, it really shifted things for some people. It made me realize that pride is something that's very internal and it goes back to the roots of being about efficacy. So I feel like there have been a lot of organizations, even the one that I represented, which focused more on celebrating and going back to the core of efficacy, and getting behind communities that really need resources such as displaced and [inaudible] community, trans women of color communities, and actively engaging in so offering resources amidst COVID.", "1951": "And I feel like that's something that I am very proud of, because we are making sure that the members who are most vulnerable have access to resources that we take for granted because we're comfortable amidst this pandemic. So shout out to my team for that. And also I've been seeing a lot of stories and testimonials where people who are advocates within the LGBT community are doing things to maintain the bonds and to lift our spirits, because LGBTQ people have always used public communities such as bars to not only just, yes... [inaudible] to deescalate, just being together, because if they're in a position where they don't have communities at home or within close proximity to where they live or other people are out, they will go to bars and these places to engage.", "1952": "So we have to think about that the bar's not only a place that offers have a good drink and meet a cute guy or girl, but it's more a place of building and networking and just having a bond of someone that understands you. So community and having access to this online platform now has been a cool thing. And so I imagine what it was like not having Internet access or WiFi, where you're just this lonely person at home, with your cat. All right. So that was me. So Shosanna, your turn.", "1953": "I'm going to pass and go at the end. I need some more time to come up with my answer.", "1954": "All right, thank you. Joelle?", "1955": "Sure, yeah. I can definitely go. In terms of community, I think that I would say that neighbors have been super thoughtful and have really been working together. I would say that for the community, I'm staying with my partner now in the Bronx, and so people have been really looking out, like providing masks. In the community outside itself, I think people have been having a really hard time having access to that, so seeing people build community amongst each other has been really nice to see. Another community that I wanted to highlight was really my work community, because they've been so thoughtful in terms of providing days for self-care, especially in everything that's happening now on top of COVID and with the protests and everything like that.", "1956": "They provided days for self-care, so not having to use it against your personal days or your sick days, and just being really thoughtful about how to be there as a resource for employees. So I've been super appreciative of that, and I feel like that has been working well. Yeah, and I think that that's really it for me.", "1957": "Cool. We'll jump to Nick.", "1958": "So I think it's for community, I define community most readily as my church community. I come from a very Christian family, and in my adult life that's something that I continued to explore. And during the quarantine, I really have been more in touch with my faith and in line with my own personal practices. And I found that that community is a community that I really heavily leaned on during this time, not only as far as COVID is concerned, but also the sociopolitical climate that's happening right now. My church is usually incredible mobile and we mobilize in the community. You're just doing outreach, and of course, a lot of that has been in person in the past, but with that not being able to...", "1959": "On the onset, I felt like I was letting down a lot of the people that I used to support, so I beat myself up. I can't go to this [inaudible 00:39:15], I can't volunteer for this service. I can't help these people in person. But that just made me think all the more creatively of what I can do for my church and how I can be there for people that I support in the past and continue to support them. And then it also made me realize when I do stuff for people, how much am I doing for them versus how much am I sort of kind of doing it for myself? Not the gratification of, oh, I'm helping people. I'm a good person. But what's my why?", "1960": "And so this time has really helped me reevaluate why am I doing the work I'm doing, and how can I make sure that it's sustainable, whether there's COVID or not? So my community is my church community, and we've come up with some pretty creative ways to work not only for the community, but also for each other, understanding that all too often, we want to help other people and forget to help ourselves. So there's days where I just don't want to talk to anybody, and that's okay. There's days where I just want to be by myself and be alone and do nothing, and that's okay. I can have those days, because I worked hard enough to enjoy those days. So keeping that in mind and really leaning on my faith and my own personal beliefs has been a huge help during this time. So that's all for me.", "1961": "[crosstalk] Amen. Lilian?", "1962": "When I think of community, the first thing that really comes to mind is always work, work, work, work. [inaudible] I'm really proud of my team members who show up at work, if not without complaints, I'm not going to say that we're great and not worried about everything that's happening. But our clients are rely vulnerable people and don't necessarily understand what's going on, and I feel like when I'm onsite, we work really well together in serving the client to be sure that their needs are taken care of, that they're [inaudible 00:41:17], and I'm really proud of my team for putting the effort in, putting the work in.", "1963": "I also think of... I volunteer with a couple other organizations, and I'm really proud to see that they're still going out there and doing this work and helping communities that are vulnerable, whether it's people who don't have access to food or LGBT youth. Those are some of the communities that I volunteer with. These people are still showing up, and they are still... Their industry, these services are [inaudible] it's important that volunteers are highlighted during this time of the pandemic, not just giving out masks and [inaudible] and stuff like that, but making sure that the basic needs of people in your neighborhood or the elderly or even the everyday person that might not, kind of like learning your unemployed, but you're just feeling a little bit overwhelmed and just need that connection there [inaudible 00:42:45].", "1964": "Thank you. Shosanna, would you like to address the question?", "1965": "Yes. So Lilian, the reason why I was like, \"I need to pass and go at the end,\" was because I, too, was thinking of work, and I was like, \"I don't know, should I say work? Let me think about it, hear what people say.\" But I have to say that I've actually disconnected from even my neighbors, a lot of people at work, and I think, I don't know, I've just always been a person where I'm all right with my own company and some Netflix. I'm okay with it. I feel comfortable with it. I'll crave to go out for dinner, but I don't crave to go out and have drinks and all of this stuff all of the time. I'm really okay with just being outside, being a homebody. That's just me, right?", "1966": "So during this time, it's been really nice to really reset my mind and really actually just step away from communities. Even my neighbors, right? We talk all the time, we'll message each other, but I also want to disconnect, because they have a little baby, right? And I go out for groceries and stuff like that. I don't ever want to be cause of oh, I brought in the virus to their home or something like that. So I just avoid it at all costs. But then when it comes to work, a lot of things that we would do together is have lunch together, or even just walk to the train together. With them, that hour, 45 minutes, we're able to get in so much, right?", "1967": "But now it's not really there. So we just text here and there. But it's really just more of working relationships right now. The personal relationships have kind of died down. It's really about just focusing on mental health right now, and with me in my community of one, just because I was in a really bad place actually last year. Very suicidal last year. It was hard. I didn't know what to do. I was going crazy. I wasn't sleeping, I was crying all the time, it was very bad. I didn't want to talk to anyone, be around anyone, it was just bad. And I started seeing my therapist back in October, and so it was really great because then I started opening up again and I started working on myself again after letting myself go for so long throughout the year.", "1968": "So really right now is just focusing on mental health, trying to feel better so that when we do go into that capacity of seeing people and going out and all of that stuff, I feel more comfortable with myself. And even like what I said before, I gained weight just from my freshman year of school to now. So a lot of that, too, has really brought me down, because I don't feel confident with myself. So right now, I'm just working on all of that, trying to feel good.", "1969": "Great. So I have a question, it's sort of not on this, but I've been personally impacted by COVID in regards to social distancing, because I really love people. I love hugging, I love engaging, directly in your face, oh, come over, let's do this and that. I was going to ask if you all are whoever, if you are a social person, and how has social distancing and actually not being able to touch and feel and embrace, if you're that type of mushy-mashy person like I am, how has that been brought into play for you? My mom is a cancer survivor, so she was high risk and in regards to her age as well. So I'm very mama's boy, so I will hug and squish my mom. But when she told me, \"Stay away, don't come in.\" It kind of made me feel like... It took me to a place like, oh, my gosh. That was the reality of this social distancing and how it could really impact someone's health.", "1970": "And she was like, \"Well...\" I know this stuff, but this is my mom. This is someone who I've always been smushy with. And that ability to not having to have that embrace or actively engage with my friends, it was always like, \"Oh, I haven't seen you in so long.\" So how has that whole experience impacted you? And this is a toss up, so you ca just raise your hand here or if you want to...", "1971": "Yeah, I can totally relate to that. I'm mama's boy on the thousand. And it was very intense and emotional. At some point, maybe at some point in April or May, we kind of just gave in and had to hug each other, because my family, we're Dominican, so it's like everyone embraces each other and hugging and... It was tough. We did a couple of drive bys in my family for graduation and all that, and so when people would see each other, it would be an emotional fest. Like everyone's crying, like, \"Oh, I can't hug you. This is so intense.\" So it has been emotional, for me at least, because I'm very social. I'm also a huggy person, and so it's been challenging, to say the least, for sure. And people depend on that. People want to be embraced. People want that and need that at some point, so it's been interesting.", "1972": "Anyone else? All right, Lilian and then Shosanna.", "1973": "Yeah. I'm not a touchy-feely person. I see my friends more than I see my family. I'm an only child on the one, so it's not like I have siblings to hang out [inaudible 00:49:05], but they're all... I don't see them very often, so yeah, I don't know. But right before the whole pandemic happened, my dad actually had a heart transplant. And he was upstate, and beyond Rockland County I think it was that quarantined, he lived beyond that [inaudible 00:49:37]. I'm his [inaudible 00:49:44]. I'm not his in home primary caregiver, but I had to take time off work. I had to do FMLA and all that stuff. And he needed help, so I was going to the [inaudible 00:50:00], I was making meals, bringing them up. I brought him supplies, all this stuff, and then all of a sudden, [inaudible] of, \"Oh, you're an essential worker.\"", "1974": "And initially, it was like you're going to still have to show up three days a week from now on. And I know that my clients are at high risk for exposure because they still spend time in the street. Now I can't see my dad. And it's not like we were close or anything like that, but he needs help, and I wanted to step up. I wanted to help him, you know? It doesn't matter how our relationship was in the past. He's my dad. And something I... I love cooking, and he's always like, \"Oh, I see the pictures you post online. I want to try that. You're making Indian food. I want to taste it. Is it spicy though?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\"", "1975": "And so he was just like, \"Oh, when are you going to come bring me... You could just leave it outside.\" And I'm like, \"Daddy, I can't. I can't just leave it outside and drive all the way from New York just to bring you food and stuff like that.\" So I haven't seen him since the beginning of March, when he just came out of the hospital. And it's also weird, the [VMS] sometimes calls me, like, \"Oh, we can't reach your dad.\" And I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" And then I have to... He always [inaudible 00:51:32], so he's okay though. [inaudible]", "1976": "Thank you. Shosanna?", "1977": "Well, Lilian, I'm glad to hear that your dad is doing okay and he's enjoying your cooking. I have to say, with this whole social distancing thing, again, I do love being at home, but I do love going out, of course. I miss just looking at people. Like, I love to... Yeah, I'm the type of person, I sit on the train, I don't read a book, I'm not really on my phone. I really just read what's on the walls. I'm in my own thoughts. And I actually just love watching someone watch a show and seeing their reactions from watching that show, or I love looking at someone shop and seeing how they're going to look at this item and how they're going to admire it. I don't know, for me, it's the outsider perspective of looking at all these good and positive things, I miss that.", "1978": "But then also, me and my mom, we don't have the best relationship, but I feel like during this time, we're able to... I can be around her bit more. I feel a bit more comfortable. I'm always in my room still, but I'm still out of my room a lot more now than I was before. So that's also good. So it's a work in progress, but I do miss seeing people in their natural habitats and looking at people and how they dress and what can I steal from them to make my wardrobe look popping like that, too. But I miss just looking at people and hearing voices. I'm tired of hearing my own voice, so yes.", "1979": "I miss looking at cute guys at the gym, too, so I'm with you on that whole observation, Shosanna. All right, thank you guys for sharing. So there was an optional part, but since everyone is really reacting and engaging, it's going very well, so I'm going to skip over that, Yule, the highlighted segment, okay? Alrighty. Next question... Okay. Here's a question for more... Oh, wait. Hm... All right. Now, we invite you to think about this conversation that we're having as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question, we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation, and that you would like other people to hear? Okay.", "1980": "I'm going to read it again so it can simmer. Now we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question, we invite you to share what is one thing that you heard today that you will be taking away from this conversation, and that you'd like other people to hear? Okay, so for me, it drew a lot of attention to different communities and aspects and how influential they are. And some of you had mentioned your work communities, and something I feel... That is something that we sometimes take for granted, and we're sometimes with more work people than we are with our families. Myself living alone, I see some of the people... And our bond has grown, and it's very important to have healthy relationships at work and develop those, because those people sometimes will be there for you and supporting you.", "1981": "So for me, it's the idea of building community wherever you are. If it's at your place of worship, if it's work, if it's the way you volunteer, those bonds could be cultivated and help positively influence our lives. So I'm definitely taking away and appreciating the bonds I have with coworkers. Yeah. So that's one thing for me. Shosanna, I know you just spoke. Are you okay with going again, or should we just run around and come back to you? Run around? Okay. We'll jump to Joelle.", "1982": "Yeah. I think I can piggyback off of what you said, Mikey, in terms of community being one thing that I think stood out for me from the conversation. Everyone has a different sense of community and what it means to them, and I think that individually we're all part of so many different communities. But it kind of goes to show how having a sense of community, regardless of what that is, really unites people and how important it is for those different communities to be able to work together to offer opportunities for people, whether it be access to healthcare or just making us feel safe and secure. And so the community piece is very important, and I think that people experience community, again, very differently, depending on what that community is.", "1983": "So it's just really interesting, and I feel very fortunate to be part of communities that are supportive. But I'm empathetic to those people who might be part of a community that are not as supportive or not as resourceful. So just being a community member amongst my own community, but also being a community member to others that are part of other communities that I might not be a part of, but still lending a helping hand. Don't know if that even answered your question, but community is what stood out for me.", "1984": "Okay. Thank you. We'll go to Nick.", "1985": "So I think what stood out to me the most across the board, everybody just had such a normalcy speaking about their mental health, and I think that's still in today's community, there needs to be a demystification and de-stigmatization, if that's a word, I don't know if that's a word, but around mental health and just having these conversations, because, especially when we're alone in quarantine, we need to be having these conversations. And there's a quote, like, \"Oh, we need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable,\" and I think that's very, very valid, but at the same time, it needs to continue to happen. All of us on this call are younger, and older generations still struggle with bridging those communication gaps.", "1986": "So I think it's very, very important that we continue to have these tough conversations and continue to make it more normal in today's society to talk about mental health and our needs. Something that Joelle had mentioned earlier with him and his family was just that emotional crying aspect. Over this period of time, I really learned that it's okay to cry. It's okay to be cathartic and get those emotions out. And I only learned that with having more of these conversations and making mental health conversations more normal to have. So I think it's important, and that stuck out to me, the normalcy that everybody just was so open about it. So I think if everybody continues to talk about their mental health and educate future generations... We've done a lot of work, we have a lot of work to do, but I'm excited to see where the conversation will go.", "1987": "Super. That's great. that's an amazing point. It is an underlying... That normally when we think of health, you just go to the physical aspects, but mental health directly impacts the physical. Super. Thanks, Nick. Lilian?", "1988": "Yeah, I'm really glad this conversation happened and everybody was so open about mental health. I hope these conversations keep happening in person. It's a little bit more uncomfortable when we're talking about mental health [inaudible 00:59:30]. But from this conversation specifically, y'all talk about your neighbors. I don't talk to my neighbors. My actual, physical neighbors, I don't talk to them. I know they have two kids. I know this one's by himself, the ones behind me, one of them's by himself. I've taken the train with him, gotten off at the same stop. He works somewhere within two blocks of me, and I don't know what he does. I can tell you his name and I can tell you his dad's name and that's about it. But I don't know my neighbors.", "1989": "I know my super. My super and I were actually part of the same community garden, which is now not a thing. But yeah, I need to be more neighborly. I need [inaudible] to Roger, because I don't know any of them. And some have packages for me.", "1990": "[inaudible] about much, many years. So I'm just social, but I feel like [inaudible] really there's a big age gap. My neighbors are much older individuals, and I'm the one that would be having my music playing or whatever and jamming. But how do you guys initiate these conversations with your neighbors? Like hi, I'm here, howdy neighbor. Want to come over for a drink? What's your buy in to building bonds with neighbors?", "1991": "I can chime in on that. I am very social in the elevator. I'm that awkward person that always will start a conversation in the three floors that we have as we travel, and I'll always just point out to something in the community, like, \"Oh, did you see that that happened?\" I live right by the waterway on the Hudson, so I'm like, \"Oh, have you walked...\" Because they're doing active construction. I'm like, \"Oh, did that construction wake you up?\" I'll make up a small back toy that I'll bring up. I very regularly will start a conversation out of nowhere or a compliment, like, \"I like your watch,\" or just bring a random fact up about masks and how inconvenient they are, but how we need to still wear them even though the weather's nice out, we should still be wearing our masks. That's my little PSA.", "1992": "But yeah, just current events is huge. COVID, and then complimenting their outfit in the elevator is how I start conversations.", "1993": "People have been very, very afraid in such small, confined spaces. People would rather, if they're like, \"Oh no, don't hold the elevator. I'll just take the stairs.\" And like, I'm on the fourth floor, and I've seen that. So I've I guess done that to help them more at ease. I'll say, \"Okay, I'll take the stairs. Have a great day. Hi, how are you?\" So I feel like there's a lot of tension around social distancing, especially within tight, confined spaces.", "1994": "I just wanted to chime in. I had been close to some of my clients who were positive or ended up going to another [inaudible] because they couldn't be in the shelter. And I had plans to go visit my family, they're like, \"Oh, we need you to get tested. Please come see us.\" I'm like, \"What? Why?\" Well, I understand why, but [inaudible] aw, you don't want to see me because you think I'm gross or something. But it's fine. We FaceTime now. We did a seven person FaceTime. It was a mess, but I loved it. It was fun.", "1995": "Is everyone still on edge with social distancing? Are there smaller groups where you take your mask off? For me, there's some people who I see all the time, and I'm very upfront to ask, so I'm going to be honest, I trust them and I know and I gauge and I'm pretty sure working in healthcare, I had antibodies somewhere, thank God. I didn't get super ill or whatever. So what have your responses been? Have you have felt you're comfortable, I'm going to slip it off?", "1996": "My philosophy is you're going to be exposed. Whether or not you have preexisting factors, you're going to be exposed. So go through life, and honestly, I'm also a bit of a pessimist. So go through life expecting the worst, and then when you come out on the other side of this and hopefully everybody does and you are well, just be so grateful and thankful that you're on the other side of it and moving forward. But yeah, I go into work like yeah, I'm going to get exposed, and yes, I also have asthma, so I'm more at risk as well. And honestly, it's not even at work, it's more on the train, because [inaudible] has been a mess, and [inaudible 01:04:45].", "1997": "Yeah, no, I'm super upfront. If I'm at the grocery store and someone's closer than six feet and no mask, I'm like, \"Excuse me, can you make distance?\" Because I'm also, I am at risk, and so I can't put my health at risk because of other people's choices. Someone asked me to get a package for them, and I was like, \"Absolutely not. No. no thank you, ma'am.\" And so I'm very upfront. I'm really serious about masks. If I know my parents, for instance, I know they're not really leaving the house. But at this point, I feel like people are being a little more loose with it, so I'm starting to lose the anxiety. But I have Mondays where I'm giving people the side eye if I see them with no mask. But yeah. I think now people are starting to feel less anxious. Personally, I'm starting to feel less anxious, and I'm comfortable going to the grocery store or walking out the door without a mask exactly. Exactly.", "1998": "Yeah. Anyone else before we start wrapping up? Well, the initial question was how are you engaging with your neighbors or making that initial attempt to build a familiarity around what's happening, and the other part was... Where was I going? Where did it go? I totally forgot where we were going with that.", "1999": "Oh, the part of the conversation that you connected with the most [crosstalk 01:06:28]?", "2000": "Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Who was left to go? Shosanna? Yeah.", "2001": "One, yes. Mental health for sure. I feel like it's really nice and refreshing to hear that everybody here on this conversation has been very comfortable with sharing mental health and personal health as well, especially with you, Joelle. You're very open to sharing your story. And growing up in the Guyanese community, it's very frowned upon to talk about your mental health. It's like, if you have mental issues or you're unstable, people look at you as you're crazy and you should go into a psychiatric facility. It's that bad. And last year, I even had a cousin who committed suicide because things that he was dealing with, and I wish he had more support in that area, where he felt more comfortable to talk about it and he felt like he had the strength to reach out.", "2002": "Which I know he did reach out, but I feel like if he'd gotten the professional help he needed, I feel like things could have gone a lot different. And who knows? He would have been in a way better place today. But definitely, mental health, and Nicholas, I love that some of the tactics that you're talking about, like your salt lamp and your essential oils and stuff like that, it's great that you have your own place where you feel comfortable and in your zone to actually do those things. Because I get what you're saying. I'm at home and I want to work out and I feel so uncomfortable to do so, because I'm like, \"God, I don't want my parents to see me doing this. They're going to think what the hell am I doing?\"", "2003": "[crosstalk] people downstairs can hear.", "2004": "Yeah.", "2005": "I feel like, oh, my god. What in the world? I feel so uncomfortable, even though it's just my parents. They made me. But I feel so uncomfortable. So it's great that you guys are becoming comfortable with those things and that taking steps to focus on your health, mental health, overall health. Not just what we see, but also what's inside. And for the question about neighbors, like I said, I've been at my house for about 17 years now, and I think the relationship really started with my parents. Because basically, my entire block, we're kind of one big community in a way. Somehow, somebody's in my backyard and somehow I reach over in their backyard within minutes. My neighbor will have a steak on the grill, like, \"Hey, so what you cooking?\"", "2006": "But it really just takes time to build. Some of you may be in your places not for that long, right? And I think just starting off with small conversations, maybe saying, \"Hey, do you want to go grab coffee or go out for dinner?\" They may view it differently, but also it may be awkward to do at first. But it's really nice to know that you can have neighbors that you can lean on in a time of need. But those relationships, they take time to build. So patience is key, and maybe a cup of sugar.", "2007": "Yeah. [inaudible]", "2008": "Can I make a quick comment really quick? I was going to say, thinking about copying you, Shosanna, I think also too with neighbors, asking people what they need. Just simply saying, \"Hey,\" and really meaning it. And people who obviously you feel a connection, because energy's also really important, because if it's somebody who's shady, you're not going to ask that. But if you tell someone, \"Hey, if you need anything, please let me know.\" People will be more open to saying, \"Hey, I really can't go to the grocery store to get this. Do you mind getting this for me?\" Or, \"Hey, I ran out of sugar, or hey, I don't have any masks.\" So just building that community, and actually meaning it. Saying, \"Hey, if you ever need anything, we're here.\" Because that is important.", "2009": "[crosstalk] That's really dope, like taking initiative. Yeah. You know what, and it should start here. Here, this is home. I feel like my floor, I should be more buddy buddy with them so they won't call the cops or band when I play loud music. But those are great things. But what's still top of my head is this idea of initiating conversations about mental health within our culture. Me from Caribbean descent, the only thing that I heard in regards to mental health was streams. Like it was either someone drinking poison, and I'm telling the words that they'll use, or hanging themselves. And there was no aspect of treatment or no discussion exploring things. So how do we initiative these within our familial structure, which then transcribes to bigger communities, like extended family, extended family then becomes this community setting? What are some ways you guys could spark up this conversation, \"Hey, how are you? How are you?\" Yeah. That's a toss up.", "2010": "I think, oh, I'm sorry. Lilian, did you want to...", "2011": "No, go ahead.", "2012": "Okay. I think you kind of touched on it really quickly, Mikey, with that deepening, \"No, but how are you actually feeling?\" I think that most readily, if you know somebody in your close personal family or circle, you kind of know how they operate on a daily basis or what their love language is, so just asking questions, like how have you been sleeping or how have you been eating? And then go from there, because if something raises a red flag, you can touch base with that and see what they're comfortable with. I think oftentimes when I'm comfortable with something, I automatically assume everybody's comfortable with it. So I'll just bring up these outlandish topics in conversation that might not be the most suitable for a dinner table or a Zoom call, but making sure that the other person feels comfortable.", "2013": "So you want to set ground rules and then also have it be like, as confidential as possible. So when you're speaking to somebody, letting them know that, hey, what we talk about stays between us, and I'm actually here for you. With everything that's going on in the world right now, I reached out to a lot of my friends who are in the African American community, and I just wanted to let them know, \"I care about you. You're valid.\" And I've had conversations with them, like how are you actually feeling? And of course, you know, \"I'm okay. I'm good.\" Because they don't want to address things. But when they felt more comfortable addressing things, they messaged me and they were like, \"Hey, I just want to let you know I really appreciate you reaching out and checking in on me.\"", "2014": "So making sure that it's a check in that doesn't happen one time, but it's something that you revisit. So it becomes more frequent, and with that frequency, oftentimes the people I have engaged with have opened up more and it's become a regular thing, and what's really nice is there's come a time where there's a sort of reciprocity, where I've checked in on you so many times and you see me moving different or acting funny, whatever you want to say, they reached out to me and it's been extremely helpful, too. So I think frequency, authenticity, and making it a safe space or just this level of it's okay. That was a lot.", "2015": "Great. Thank you. Lilian, you had something to say.", "2016": "I was going to say using yourself, it's a technique that we use at work, using yourself as a point of reference, just like In this conversation that we've been having. And I feel like this is very [inaudible] of having conversations, like oh, I've had this experience and now I want you to tell me what your experience is that is related to this. So when it comes to speaking to my family about mental health, I try to speak about if I'm feeling something in the moment, I try to talk about that. I will say though that having a background in mental health, I feel like sometimes my family's a little bit more hesitant to be honest with me about their feelings, because they think I'm just going to try to diagnose them. And I'm not, I'm not.", "2017": "But no one ever wants it pointed out. Like oh, I see this is happening. You're showing signs of depression and you need help. No. Just like oh, hey... I mentioned to my cousin that I had started seeing a therapist, and then my cousin [inaudible] for that. And I hope it's helpful for him [inaudible] always using yourself as a reference to start the conversation. Because maybe someone might say, \"Oh yeah, I know someone, but [inaudible 01:15:15].\" Even amongst your family.", "2018": "Yeah. There's so much that has been happening, and we focus a lot on the pandemic, but the whole movement that's happening now and the protests and what's been going on, it's been sending ripples. So what are your feedback [inaudible] of the protests as people of color, see things on television or in our communities being attacked, and the general feelings about this? For me, in regards to health, I've been really anxious about it. So I just wanted to offer that for you guys.", "2019": "I know I just finished, so I'll speak really quickly again. I think I'm at a very interesting crossroads. So my mother's Irish-American and my father's Puerto Rican-American, so I'm pretty racially ambiguous. Some days I can just look different based on what I'm wearing or the vernacular I choose to use, and I think that the way I represent myself has changed drastically, because all of this, everything that's happening, I normally very openly identify as a member of the Latinx community, but growing up I was always too Caucasian to be with my Puerto Rican family, and then way too [inaudible] to be with all my Irish family. So I thought when I was younger, I had to choose which community I had to be a part of growing up. In my adult life, I realized that I can embrace both, and it's my whole self.", "2020": "But as far as in regards to the current social climate and movement that's happening, I really learned to only speak to my truth, and speak from that I perspective, but also realize that I have been very fortunate to present certain levels of privilege throughout my life. And I realize that I was only able to start making change and speaking influentially when I used that privilege to help others. So I very actively try to use my social platforms to reach the followers that I have of different demographics, but also to reach some of my family that might disagree with certain things I believe in or certain things that are going on right now. So I really try to use the privilege that I have and really understand the power that that has while at the same time, navigating how that might make me feel, understanding that my voice might be received differently about a topic, because I'm not a member of that community. So I know again that was a lot to unpack, but yeah. That's what I have to say about that.", "2021": "Lilian, did you have something to say in regards to [inaudible 01:17:55]?", "2022": "Yeah, I was just going to say, I do identify as African American. I'm also Puerto Rican, [inaudible] a whole lot of nicknames going on. But similar to what Nick was just talking about, I'm too dark for my Puerto Rican side and I'm too light for the black side, so I feel like I'm in the middle, and I identify more as Latina because I was raised more on that side of my family, and always spent more time with those cousins and stuff like that. But regardless, I'm just not surprised anymore. I feel a little defeated, and I'm not surprised, and weirdly in this whole conversation, what's been coming to my mind is I grew up in the projects on Staten Island, and that was where I felt most comfortable.", "2023": "And here, yeah, there's a stigma of Staten Island, number one, like it's predominantly Caucasian and Republican. Yeah, that's right, that's true, that is true in the '80s and '90s when I lived there, and it's true now. But the community that I lived in wasn't like that. My mom had me bust out of that community to go to a better school [inaudible 01:19:22]. It wasn't necessarily a better school. Maybe on paper. But it's never fun being the only black kid in class. And back home I was seen as... I remember one of my teachers was like, \"Oh...\" On my dad's side, my grandfather and my father identified as Jewish, and my teacher was like, \"Oh, you can't be Jewish because you're black.\" And I was like, \"What?\" And maybe not religiously, no, I don't follow any religion. But no, this is part of the culture that my dad was raised in, and how did I express that as a child?", "2024": "And even now as an adult, how do you express that? I don't know. I was thinking about my, like even today, I have to tell one of my clients later, \"Listen, just go with this [inaudible] right now. I don't want you staying in the streets because it's not safe to be a black man right now.\" And I don't like having to say that, and I had to speak about it under supervision, which I have rapport with, and everybody keeps [inaudible 01:20:40], having the conversation with your child who's of color, weirdly having to have this conversation with my clients, most of whom are older than me, and it's uncomfortable. So that's where I am.", "2025": "Cool. Thank you. Anyone else? I have an interesting question. So my question is in regards to community of color and providers, choosing or accessing providers. I have my biases, for example, when I have a dermatologist, I make sure they're a person of color, because I feel like they understand more. And also as a primary care physician, I will find an LGBTQ provider, because I feel like I'm more able to speak, \"Hey, girl, this is what's going on.\" To have that bond with my providers. What's your feedback on that, when choosing providers?", "2026": "I have to say... Oh. When choosing a provider, I've never been one to not talk to someone because of race. That's always the last thing I think about. For me, it has to be just knowledge, what's in your brain? Can you help me? So I do a lot of research and see what the reviews are on this doctor, because I can then go for a doctor of color and then the way they treat their patients is terrible, right? So for me, it's never, ever been about color. It's always been about knowledge and what people say and what their experience has been, and if they do accept my insurance.", "2027": "That's a good one. Thank you. [inaudible] Nick.", "2028": "Yeah. I, on the other hand, actually very consciously choose my providers, and I try to be an educated consumer also where I'm spending my money on their political agendas. So I very actively, whether it's mental health or sexual health, my therapist I made sure was... I felt more comfortable talking to another homosexual man, because I feel like he could most readily identify with life experiences that I've had. And then as far as my doctors are concerned, I normally go to somebody within my own community, because I want to support that local community [crosstalk 01:23:19]. Yeah, I would travel to the city a lot for specialists, and I realized I'm only making money for somebody that's not going to give back to my community. They're going to go back to their communities and invest there.", "2029": "So I would try to spend my money as much as I can, as crazy as this sounds, if you ask any of my friends, I don't have an Amazon account. I refuse to shop on Amazon. I'd rather find a mom and pops and support somebody in my local community. Recently I bought a ring light, because I want to get back into making YouTube videos, so I bought a ring light and I cracked and I shopped on Amazon, but I very actively try to support my own community, be it my church-based community, my local community where I live geographically, or just the LGBT community. I want to support businesses that are owned by people that look like me and also support political agendas that will further my community.", "2030": "So I don't eat at certain places or I won't order certain foods, although obviously Chick-Fil-A chicken is amazing. I've tried it once, the forbidden fruit, but I don't really support businesses or corporations that don't support me. So I'm sorry I rambled, but yeah, that's me.", "2031": "Anyone else?", "2032": "Yeah, I... Go ahead, Lilian. Go ahead, go ahead.", "2033": "Oh, all I was going to say is my therapist, I think I just referred to my therapist, and their name is very similar to my name, very white-sounding or Caucasian-sounding, so to speak, so I wouldn't have necessarily known that they were a person of color. But when I met my therapist, in my head, I was like, \"Oh. [inaudible 01:24:54]\" So yeah, and I never really thought of picking a provider that is of color. But one of my close friends actually does that. She picks people within the community that are Latino, and I was just like, \"Oh, that makes...\" I understand why she does it, and I try to be a little bit more conscientious about who I do pick, mostly because at the end of the day, someone's private practice, humans are doctors [inaudible] or whatever, it's still a small business and you want to support them.", "2034": "Great. Joelle?", "2035": "Yeah, I think the way that I choose my providers really boils down to bedside manner. Zocdoc, I live in Zocdoc, so really looking at reviews, looking at what people are saying about their bedside manner. I've had really horrific experiences with doctors and people who... I think Shosanna, you mentioned that a lot of doctors and specialists, they just want you in and then want you out. I'm like, even though my insurance is paying for it, this is a service, and I deserve to have my questions answered, to really be thoughtful. And so I'm really big on that. If I go into your office and you're trying to get me out, you're going to hear from me personally that I'm going to switch my provider.", "2036": "So yeah, it really is about bedside manner for me. And I think in Zocdoc, too, they have their pictures, so of course, I want to support my POC peeps, but I'm also big on reviews and what people are saying about their bedside manner.", "2037": "Super. Anyone else? I love that. Thank you for sharing those experiences. So, if anyone doesn't have any more questions, just a reminder of what will happen within the next context is that these recordings will be transcribed, indexed, and eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in the Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, New York City Health Department. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voices Network. If you want to convene another group of friends to participate or no, others who want to participate in this discussion, please go to LVN.org and hit me up. So I just want to say thank you so much for joining and sharing your thoughts and lived experiences. Yay! So we're going to stop the recording in a few, and thank you all so much for your time today.", "2038": "So I unmuted myself. I unmuted myself to say, thank you all so much for sharing your valuable time. I know how time is, so that, you are really helping and also your valuable insights. So I have a script here that I'm going to be reading on and off. And, but really what this is going to be is a conversation among all of us to get a better idea of health, how we perceive health in our community. And your insights in that regard and no need to share very personal information on this. But it's, whatever your experience is, is valued and honored.", "2039": "So I'm going to read this, \"Welcome to this conversation of 'Local Voices Network,' and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation.\" So we're being recorded and here is the official line of what our conversations about. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And then third, we want to create unique and listening channel through which we will all lift up the voices and needs of the community, the candidates, local policy makers, and members of the media.\"", "2040": "\"So what's being said is going to be shared, and distillated among many conversations across the city. And it won't be personal to you specifically. But a lot of the ideas and themes will go out to these places. And to this end, we are inviting you to have different types of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experiences, rather than beginning the conversations with our positions on issues. And this conversation, you were invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community.\"", "2041": "And again, rather than sharing highly personalized health information, you don't need to do that. So please just general sense of things. So now this, I actually have to read verbatim because it's an agreement from the lawyers. So here we go, \"This conversation is being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at 'Discretion' with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to 'The operator of the Local Voices Network' to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media to improve our understanding of each other. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper website.\" We hope. \"Or be broadcast on a local radio station, here also including other forms of media. So please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. So if you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.\" Alex, do we just all say it together or do we go around?", "2042": "I agree.", "2043": "I agree.", "2044": "I agree.", "2045": "Is that good, Alex?", "2046": "Hi, sorry. I'm feeding my baby right now, as you can tell. Each say, I agree.", "2047": "You have to do it in order, or we just...", "2048": "Each individually say I agree.", "2049": "So I guess, do you want to just do, I don't know how my gallery starts on top left with David. So do you want to just go through David and just say I agree. And then Leslie, then Tony then Linda.", "2050": "It's Leslie I agree.", "2051": "I agree.", "2052": "Now Tony. You have to unmute.", "2053": "I'm unmuted.", "2054": "Just unmute and say I agree. Good? Alex, good? I'm assuming so. So we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to share and to learn from each other in this conversation and support the goals and guidelines we have for the conversation. So here, I'm going to sort of let what the guidelines are.", "2055": "I mean, the kind of conversational guidelines, regardless of the context. But this is when it says, \"Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, you have the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns, stay curious, ask honest questions, pause, take time for reflection, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact and when possible close unnecessary programs, applications and notifications, and put your phone on silent. So everyone's on board with these guidelines I guess, right?", "2056": "So we're going to start our conversation and it should take, up to an hour and a half, but it could take less, but we're going to try to sort of keep it moving. So for the ease of this virtual conversation, and I guess Alex are going to be helping with this technology. We're going to use a modified circle process where each unit person is going to be able to take a turn. And Alex, are you posting the order by which people are going to transition from one person to the next?", "2057": "You can actually just use the order in the chat.", "2058": "In the chat [inaudible] on the chat. So good, will just pull it up. So I'm going to move the little chat thing down. So all right. So does anyone... If you don't want to say anything you can always pass or ask for a pass and we can come back to you. And that's fine too. And you're not obligated to say anything. And the other thing that you could know if you want is that if you want this to be anonymous and your full name won't be used anyway but you could put a pseudo name or just put your first name. And I think that Alex already talked about that, on the little identifying rectangle for Zoom. Anyway, so we're going to... Do you guys have any questions about all of this or does it all make sense, it's good?", "2059": "So we're going to begin with just a real quick round of introductions. You can share your first name and a little bit of background info about who you are, where you live and what you do. And here's the sort of like thinking part is like a value that's important to you, and what brought you here today? So I will start to sort of ease that. So my name is Deb, and I am facilitating this conversation because I work with Project Hospitality and I do media grant writing, and wear all sorts of different hats. So I was tapped to be the volunteer facilitator because I believe Local Voices Network is working with a bunch of not-for-profits, local non-for-profits to try to get volunteers. So thank you guys again. And also to start these conversations in local communities.", "2060": "So that's what I do fundamentally and a value that's important to me is integrity. I think maybe because that comes easily to me and other values I struggle with. But I appreciate, sort of living from a space of knowing and clearly communicating intention. And knowing intention is hard, but when one knows it, I believe it's really important people in your life to be able to share that and not opt to skate and integrity just in life, the way we live, towards others, towards our planet, et cetera. I haven't achieved it 100%, but sure. So I guess the next is David, I guess you have to unmute and then I'll mute myself here.", "2061": "Is that better? Do you hear me now? I've been with Linda and we've been volunteering for over 20 years now, in different food pantries and soup kitchens. Unfortunately, the soup kitchen are now all shut down, but we're still doing, project of, it's a Project Hospitality at the El Centro, it's a.... Deb your muted. Anyway, we've been doing the food pantry at El Centro-", "2062": "Sorry to interrupt though, I was just asking maybe if Linda can mute because she's the only one that require some feed back. That's all. Sorry.", "2063": "I miss that. I'm not hearing her right now. Just serving the community and doing what we can and...", "2064": "That's not [inaudible].", "2065": "Yes it's you.", "2066": "I'm sorry.", "2067": "Turn your volume down. That might help. There we go. Linda is sitting right next to me on the couch, but she's using her phone. So it makes it a little-", "2068": "Oh, hard.", "2069": "A little interesting. I don't know what to say. I just enjoy being out there, meeting people and doing all we can to help them. So that's all, I have to say.", "2070": "So is it okay to pass it to Linda now?", "2071": "Sure.", "2072": "So I'll repeat the questions, just sort of who you are, a little of your background, if you'd like to share where you live and value if you'd like to share.", "2073": "Move on your way.", "2074": "Hi, can you... Hello?", "2075": "I can hear, I guess everyone else can hear, I'll just do this.", "2076": "You can hear me?", "2077": "Yeah.", "2078": "Well, like David says, we've been doing this for a number of years now, but I work mainly with El Centro Project Hospitality, and there's been such a tremendous amount of people coming. We usually service 88 or 100 people. It has grown now to over 300 people. So when I'm there, like two hours at a time, it is now grown to four to five hours because now people are not allowed into the building and we had to get all this food and produce out to the people. So it's a tremendous amount of work now.", "2079": "But it's so rewarding and I'm so glad I'm still able to do it. And we work with a wonderful team of people. It's like we all think together, to anticipate what we need from each other. We really don't need it to be told what to do. We just know what we have to do to get everything out. And getting all these people taken care of in the amount of time that we have, it's amazing really. I have been doing this for 20 years, I guess. And now that I'm not working anymore, we have been devoting, excuse me, more time. But like David says, soup kitchens have closed up, so we don't do that anymore. However, I'm team leader for New York Cares, so I also do that, [crosstalk].", "2080": "Is there value... I'm sorry to interrupt. But is there a value like, I mean, it sounds like you guys are really involved in the community and service. Is there like a specific word for a value that you and David might share or have individually that sort of define your outlook or these for the day today? If you wanted to put that comment in.", "2081": "What value?", "2082": "Yeah, value, a general value. I mean, I hear you're talking a lot about serving the community. If there's something-", "2083": "Oh, being able to serve the community, being able to give back to the people around here. And so certainly it is a very satisfying feeling to be able to do something. And of course taking all the precautions that we can.", "2084": "All right, [inaudible].", "2085": "But notice we're kind of old.", "2086": "I mean, anyone who goes in and serves, that's, they [inaudible] after you and that's amazing regardless.", "2087": "But it's interacting with the volunteers and with the people that come to the pantry.", "2088": "Thank you so much. And then so Tony, same questions for you. If you want to talk a little about your name just like, because I already just said it, but a little background about who you are, where you live, what you do, just a little background, and if you want to share a value, that's important to you. I think you're muted.", "2089": "I know. It took me awhile to find the button for the unmute. So I'm going to start with the value because I'm going to have to ask you to repeat the other stuff, but I guess one of the values that I feel strongly about is open-mindedness. And what were some of the other things that you wanted me to speak on Deb? I'm sorry. I can't hear you, you're muted.", "2090": "Just very briefly, what you do, where you live and I think that's all.", "2091": "Okay. So this is my second career. I've been doing it now for three years. I used to work in book publishing in Manhattan and I've lived in St. George for the past 20 years. And I would say only for the last three years, have I been doing occupational therapy? I've been working with children in the schools and doing some early intervention work with really little kids, previous to that. So that's pretty much it for me.", "2092": "Thank you. And then Leslie, sort of the same questions, just a little about who you are, where you live, what you do and a value that's important to you.", "2093": "Well, my name is Leslie and I live in New Brighton, Staten Island, and I'm a teacher. I'm a classroom teacher, I teach English, English as a second language and special education. I've been teaching for 19 years. And what do I value? That's a really hard question. I have a lot of values, right now, what I really value is equity. I would like to see that more in life and life practices. I'm Asian Pacific American female, I often feel like I don't matter, I am not important and that for whatever reason. And I would like to see more equity happen for Asian Pacific Americans and just really everybody in general.", "2094": "Thanks so much, you bring up a really important topic and value, especially obviously today when it's seems like it's coming up in conversation in a big way, nationally and hopefully it continues. And that's your lived experience, which is like so valuable, that you understand it from a first person point of view. So the next thing we're going to do as we thank you guys for all sharing is we're going to invite you to share a little bit about yourself. We started there, but we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today. So I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing look like to you, in your mind, if you had to envision what health and wellbeing is.", "2095": "And then as you reflect, think of maybe a time and a place, a story, when you felt like you were at your best in terms of health and wellbeing, and what can you remember, about why you felt in that moment, healthy and like a sense of wellbeing and what were the factors that supported your feelings at that moment in time, whatever they may be external, internal. And so we'll go around one at a time to share our stories and remember this is being recorded. So you don't have to disclose too many personal [inaudible] sensitive information or sensitive health information, just generally telling your story about a time in your life when you really felt a whole healthy and a sense of wellbeing.", "2096": "And I'll start this one, again, just to make it easier. And that's part of the protocol, but I'm going to go with a more recent story just because it's easier to remember. But we're all obviously in quarantine and again, kudos Linda and David for like getting out and being with the community and being, serving the community even as we were in quarantine. I myself, I'm in quarantine with my family, with two kids. Oh, I'm not supposed to give too much information, but it's a lot of chaos at times. So we took a trip and I'll say it's four kids. We took a trip to a couple of weeks ago camping. And it was just a couple of days. And I felt like the moment we arrived I realized how much tension I had been under because there was nothing to do, no house to clean, no food to cook, no homework to tend to.", "2097": "And we were... I think one of the factors that really contributed to my sense of wellbeing besides just having that ease is being in nature and having that open space and we brought our bikes. So there was an exercise element in it, which is, I think always helps with wellbeing. I've done yoga before and I feel like after yoga, I always feel better. I haven't done that in a while. So I guess the factors that supported my health and wellbeing was, being around family in a different context out of the stress nature, exercise and just a good way of cooking over the fire and that sort of thing, it felt normal and so that was my recent experience of feeling healthy. So thank you. And I'm going to pass it to David and I'm going to mute myself.", "2098": "Well, at 70, I'm slowing down a little bit. I was an avid bicycle, or whole, most of my life. And I find it at my age, I'm losing my equilibrium to the point where bicycling is no longer comfortable, which really bothers me, but I suck it around and within limits as I'm aging, arthritis is setting in, that limits me, but I feel I'm doing okay. So as much as I can, I would love to be going camping. We haven't been camping in over eight years, but we used to go regularly every year. But we get out as much as we can. Linda does a good job of pushing me, so it doesn't allow me to be lazy. And we go... I'm trying to hear here. We do as much as we can, I enjoy that. I grew up on the West coast and did a lot of outdoor stuff, so I'm just as comfortable being outdoors as I am being indoors and spending so much time indoors with the quarantine, it doesn't excite me that much. I'd rather be outside.", "2099": "Thank you. Thanks so much, if you have anything else to add or...", "2100": "No, that's about it. I'm happy.", "2101": "And I'm also from the West coast, so we've got that in common. Tony, would you like to also talk about thinking about a time in your life when you felt you were at your best, you felt healthiest in your life and some of the things that were in place that supported that for you at that time?", "2102": "Sure thing. So I would probably say last summer. I have some current gastro intestinal problems that I didn't have prior to that, they started, I would say in like February or March and they've been chronic. But prior to that, we were on vacation in Sicily, and we had a fantastic vacation last summer. And just like you had mentioned the relaxation, just being with my family, being away from stress, being in a new place and the excitement of being in that place, the food that we had, the experiences that we had, the warmth of people around me. And despite the fact that I wasn't doing... I do a lot of weightlifting. I lift three days a week, even throughout this, I managed to do things in my basement and in my yard. And I have some old school things. I have a hundred pound anvil that I log around and things like that. And I do things. So when I was in Sicily, I pretty much relaxed and just did a few things. And I still felt as healthy as I've ever felt. So I would say that was an important time just being able to relax with my family.", "2103": "Thanks Tony. And Linda, did you want to share some experiences, about when you have felt healthiest and why that might've been?", "2104": "Well, this is funny, because, actually is that in this time that I feel the healthiest after I retired from work, all that stress of traveling, my kids are grown, they have their own family. And when you don't have to worry so much about your kids, there's such a sense of freedom and that will come to you in time. Camping is wonderful, I did that a lot with my kids, and I'm so glad that we did it when we were able to. But now, even though I'm quarantined at home, I don't have to travel that, traveling to work will add so much stress to your life. And I have been doing it so long that, you're like a hamster on a wheel constantly trying to get somewhere, trying to get to work, trying to make it on time. And that was so stressful during that time.", "2105": "And the stress would build on you that you don't even realize that you have it because you do what you have to do, with the kids, and making a living and everything. But now that I've been retired, I have more time to do what I like to do, and volunteering is part of it, meeting new people. And a lot of times these volunteer activities is like a lot of, it's a form of exercise that I enjoy doing. And you don't realize you're getting quite a workout here. And so I'm just happy that I'm healthy enough to enjoy life still and all my grandkids.", "2106": "Thanks so much for sharing that beautiful thought. And now, Leslie, you want to share?", "2107": "Well, I appreciate what Linda just said about commuting and what a toll it takes. I can understand that too. I think that the time when I feel healthy and a sense of wellbeing is when I'm eating, right. That's really important to me, eating right, is eating a lot of vegetables and not eating a lot of sugar and not drinking. When I can really get ahold of my eating and not eat a lot of processed food, I feel a lot better, when I'm cooking and eating super healthy, not drinking any alcohol, that helps a lot. And moderate exercise.", "2108": "I actually, I'm 54 and very strenuous exercise is not really good for me, light walking, swimming, that's when I feel best, when I just do some light walking and swimming. And a story when I felt really whole and healthy and a sense of wellbeing, I would say now, except that I'm recovering from knee surgery, but like Linda, I don't have to travel right now. I don't have to commute and that's really helping a lot, I can sleep in, I'm sleeping really regularly. So all those things, and I'm being really careful with my diet right now. All that's been really good.", "2109": "Thanks, Leslie. I mean, it was interesting to listen to everyone and it seems like among us there a lot of common scenes, in terms of, we're lucky to be able to get away, if you think about Leslie's value of equity in thinking about, in communities where people might not have that option of leaving the daily behind, even for those moments of vacation, how that might become stressful and Linda and Leslie talked about commuting and we know on Staten Island which has one of the longest commute times in the nation. It does according to census pictures. So generally on average and just moving from place to place in itself and that ongoing struggle. And some other themes that came up were, obviously exercise and healthy food.", "2110": "Again, some themes that we're lucky enough to be able to access, and that's wonderful. But again, I think when you think about equity, not everybody has that capacity to find that healthy food or to afford that healthy food, or to have the presence of mind, and also to be able to get regular exercise. It's great to be able to go to a gym or a park, but I just keep thinking of your value of equity Leslie, because what we're going to talk about now is we're going onto like the community focused conversation. So this is your insight into how we can improve our communities. So we're going to move into a conversation about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community.", "2111": "For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think about community broadly and share this either about your neighborhood community or your social community. And when you're responding to questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you're thinking of when you share your story, so local or wherever. I have a few questions to start off, but this is also can be a time of some back and forth. I guess, if you want to unmute, if you have a comment or there's a button there, if you have like the reactions button at the bottom of the Zoom screen, if you want to raise your hand or whatnot. But just again, your ideas about health and wellbeing in your community, social community, your friends, your geographic community, just sort of identify what community you're thinking of.", "2112": "So I have a few questions to start us off, but just respond to points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group, being mindful that everyone has a chance to talk and whatnot. So this is, these are just a couple of questions to think about, what your community is [inaudible] working well to support your health and wellbeing, and what are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing. If you want to share a story from your experience, that'll help, kind of illustrate that better. That would be good. And what are you learning about your community? The wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic and that you might want other people to understand. And if you have to worry about that, that's great. And I guess, Alex, this is where you have a recording?", "2113": "I actually, I will play the recording after folks share.", "2114": "Oh, okay. I'm sorry.", "2115": "That's okay.", "2116": "After a full round, it says play auto. Oh, sorry, I didn't look at my left. So yes, the other recording is after, I apologize. So just again, Leslie, I saw that you had typed to some of these questions", "2117": "Oh, you did it again. Thank you.", "2118": "I'll type them in this chat. So just to sort of stay on track, but again, your thoughts about health in your geographic, in your social community or any other type of community you can sort of define as community and how you see health and wellbeing there, what's working well. And also maybe some insight into how you've seen the health and wellbeing in your community, in this pandemic. So I'm going to unmute, and I guess David it goes to you and if you guys want to interject, we can make this a little more informal when other people are talking.", "2119": "Okay, I'm not sure what I can add to this. We're doing a lot of work in Sydney Harbor. It's just nice to be able to work with people in the area, people in the neighborhood and see what we can do. And just meeting people and seeing what their needs are. I know with, working at El Centro, we had an average client list there, about 50 people a week, and now we're pushing 300 a week, every week. So it opens up the, the base of the people that are out there. And I have always enjoyed languages. So I try to get along with or get to meet as many people as I can.", "2120": "I understand more Spanish than I do, than I speak, but I also understand Italian, German, and I can read Chinese. I can't speak it, but I can read it. I took three years of Chinese calligraphy, but they had me so confused in there, because half the people spoke Mandarin, half the people spoke Cantonese and nobody would tell me what they were telling me, in what dialogue they were talking. Oddly enough, when I was in high school, many many years ago, I was able to hold a conversation in Japanese.", "2121": "And I'd never spoken to another Japanese person since then, and forgot all about it until my son was just taking computer graphics and started explaining things to me about the Japanese [inaudible]. I said, \"Wait, I understand what you're saying. Just tell me what you talking about.\" So he goes, \"What do you mean dad?\" I said, \"I used to speak Japanese, but I'd forgotten that I even spoke it.\" so being able to get out there. My next thing is Russian, because we have a lot of Russian clients in El Centro. And it's amazing how being able to speak a few words of a language to a person in their own language is enough to endear you to them, and they become very friendly for you.", "2122": "So language is wonderful. And that's interesting that there are a lot of Russian clients in El Centro. But what do you think about, like speaking another language, learning another language, kind of supports health, or might support health in your community. And have you seen anything about the community and maybe resiliency in the pandemic, whether it's ability to communicate with each other better or anything that could support health and wellbeing?", "2123": "Well, it's true. Even if you're not fluent in language, a few words in a language and spoken to somebody will help them to open up and they open up to you and tell you things that they might not tell somebody who doesn't, who's not willing to do that. So it's a matter of opening a line of communication.", "2124": "So being able to feel connected to other people is, it's good for probably everybody's health.", "2125": "Absolutely.", "2126": "Can we go around the circle, go to Tony, wait, Tony, you were going next, right? Oops, you have to unmute but the [crosstalk]-", "2127": "There we go.", "2128": "I can type the question again, if you want to pull up chat, I sort of typed some of it in and thanks for having done that.", "2129": "I kind of saw part of it. So speaking to dovetailing a little bit off of what David just said. It sounds like David you have a natural linguistic talent. I'm a bit envious because I've been in many places in the world and it's always been hard for me to learn languages. I lived in Germany for a couple of years and it was difficult when I was younger, even. So one thing I wanted to say is when about language and it's something I wish I had more of a skill in, because when you do show an effort to speak somebody's language, it shows some respect for their culture, and they're much more willing to kind of listen to you, meet you halfway and they become more interested in you too.", "2130": "And it also shows an open mindedness towards your culture, which I think is really important. When we traveled, I noticed that made a big difference. And when we were talking to Sicilians and stuff, we made even just a little effort. They appreciated that. I wanted to say, in my community, one of the things that I've really appreciated, and this is from the beginning, not just recently with the COVID-19 thing and everything is my immediate neighbors. I have good neighbors see their side of me. And also across from us, we're close to the Ganas community. They're an intentional living community, who's been here since I think the '80s, they've been here a long time and we've talked and been friendly with a number of members from the community. They own some of the ETG businesses in the area. I don't know. Let me look quickly at the chat again. I have access to that, just to make sure.", "2131": "Yeah, I mean, I think you touched on a lot of the questions, what is your community is working to support your health and wellbeing and some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your community's health and wellbeing-", "2132": "These are all positive things. One thing I'd like to see more is... Because I've noticed that in this time right now, with COVID-19, that some people have gone out and they've really met a lot of people's expectations and really tried to help other people. And I just would like to see more of that. I've seen some negative as well with that, where I've seen racism towards Asians. I've seen my own family included. I've seen... Now we're seeing racism now in the news all over the place. But just prior to that, that's what I was seeing in the area, is I was seeing racism toward Asians and which is really unfortunate. I think those kinds of isms, they come from ignorance and if people just, would be a little open and listen and be willing to start up a dialogue they would understand that what they're doing isn't founded on anything, it doesn't have a basis.", "2133": "You're just pretty clear, you're talking about racism because the COVID-19 seem to have started in Wuhan China, and most people-", "2134": "Yeah, in China. So they look at, it's the classic guilt by association, you generalize something that may have been with some people of a certain country or race, and then you generalize that to all members of that population and you blame anybody you see who looks like that, it's just ridiculous. So that's all, Deb you earn the money with that.", "2135": "Just a question on that one. I mentioned that one, I had the unique opportunity when I went to high school. When I got to high school age, my family moved to Hawaii, which was back in the '60s. And I went from what was almost an entirely white community to a community that was not white. It became a minority, we were the minority and there was a little tension about white people there because many of the white people there came from the upper echelon of income. And that was, so it was more of an economic thing than it was a racial thing.", "2136": "But oddly enough, within a month of my going back, transferring to high school in Hawaii, there was an incident that I had nothing to do with, that made me, made all the other white students rather leery of me. And all my friends in high school were local people, of all different races, which is how I got to learn to speak Japanese, because one of my best friends, which was a very close neighbor was Japanese. And that was, it was an eyeopening experience of going away from someplace where you're an absolute majority to a place where you're in the minority and you better make friends with the other minority people there too. That's my take on it.", "2137": "I mean, it sounds like when you talk about health and that, I mean it's talking about stressors and I guess people of East Asian descent now, are feeling it based on all sorts of stuff that has been said about COVID-19, which we can question the true stuff. And, but I think when you are under stress, because you feel like you're other than, or that people are going to be prejudiced against you based on how you look, or you walk down the street and you're looking over your shoulder because you think whomever may say something to you about who you are, I mean, that impacts your psychological health. And so that in itself could just be a daily stress. And we're seeing that now on the streets obviously, with everyone talking about equity and people just being targeted for what they look like. And I can imagine that that stresses health right there, just that one little aspect prejudice. And so I just wanted to like interject.", "2138": "And yet we were all dying for Chinese food. I mean China was fine.", "2139": "It's crazy.", "2140": "Is that crazy? We were dying for an egg roll.", "2141": "It was so hard? I actually stood outside of a place and I saw somebody go outside and I recognized them. They were next door to the restaurant and I guess they lived next door. And I asked when do you think you're going to open again, I was like, \"When are you going to open again.\" I mean, things are [inaudible]. Right Leslie.", "2142": "Yeah, there are more stores that are opening, more restaurants that are opening. Definitely.", "2143": "Do you want to say a little more about how, you see your community's health or with the pandemic or generally social, geographic, all of that, your health community, what you've seen, that's been working, what might not have been working?", "2144": "I don't leave the house very often because we're in a pandemic crisis. So I only go out for the things that I absolutely need, which is food, or I have to go to the doctor. So I don't leave too often. But I've noticed since March, that the COVID-19 and pandemic crisis has brought out the best and the worst in people, and in our community as well, some of the best things that have happened where I was walking down the street, right in front of my house, and some white man stopped me and said, \"Do you live here?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" And I was really leery. And he goes, I like Asian people. I was like, \"Okay, thank you.\" And then my daughter run into the house. So it was like the best thing that could happen, it was random, he was like, \"I like greeting people.\" And some of the worst things, I've had people cough in my face and think that's funny.", "2145": "I've had people roll down their windows and look at me and say odd shoe to my face. I've been sitting in doctor's offices and I heard a young girl say that she is sure that China is to blame for COVID-19 and that China drop a huge bomb and she's sticking to it. And a huge bomb has COVID-19 germs all over the world. So those things that have happened in my community as well, I've also witnessed allyship, which is, when that happened, I told that girl, I said, look, I'm offended. I'm absolutely offended by what you said. And she said, that's not your business miss. I said, \"Yes, it is my business. When you spread misinformation, that's my business.\" And somebody else in that doctor's office stood up and said, \"I agree. You did say that miss. You did say that. And I don't agree either.\"", "2146": "I've witnessed allyship and how important it is. Next time I ever hear anybody say anything to somebody who's wearing hijab or is Muslim, \"I am going to quickly scan the room to make sure I'm okay.\" I would say, \"You, don't talk like that. You can't say that to that person. That's racist.\" Do not say that about that person, because this new experience in my community of the racism that I've been experiencing, because I'm Asian Pacific American has made me really feel for what Muslims must have experienced after 9/11. And that I am going to definitely speak up on their behalf and that it's not okay to make fun of people for wearing what they wear or their beliefs.", "2147": "And that's something in my community I would like to see more of, I would like to see more allyship. I would like to see us coming together. But as a whole, like I said, I've seen some like best and worst experiences. Just when my hope is fading, that man was, stopped me in the street and said, \"Are you Asian?\" I'm like, \"No, you didn't say that.\" He was like, \"Are you Chinese.\" I'm like, \"Yes.\" He was, \"Oh I like Chinese.\" [crosstalk], only to know they're okay. It's just been a really strange journey, and I definitely feel paranoid all the time. I feel singled, I feel like when things happen, I feel like a black man must have felt in the 1940s or '50s, like with what James Baldwin, I think once he said, \"You do not know the fear and the paranoia that the black man feels.\" So like every single, slight you think, \"Oh, is it because I'm Asian? Is that why I'm being picked the last to go into the store,\" or somebody like a wheelchair runs over my toe and think, \"Well, is that because I'm Asian? And that...\"", "2148": "God forbid if I were white or if I were black and somebody ran over my toe, what would happen? But me being an Asian female, it's okay to run over an Asian female toe? And I feel like I constantly have to fight and be assertive now, I have to choose, do I want to lay over and just like, \"Oh, fine, treat me the way you want.\" Or am I going to speak out, and am I overdoing it sometimes? Or no, I definitely have a right to speak out. I would like more support in this because I feel paranoid sometimes. And I'm not sure what I should be doing.", "2149": "I mean, again, just to talk about health too, I hear you and I feel for that. But when you say feeling paranoid and all of that, that's mental health that's like, this is your community, this is your neighborhood country, city, borough, whatever, and to have to feel that is, it's not good for your mental health or your physical health. And so I see especially like now that the conversation is starting and like you said like African-Americans and the uprising or whatever, whatever kind of, and I think all of us have some sense of feeling other in one way or another, but you are experiencing it profoundly right now. And to bring it back to health again I hear what you're... It sounds like there's a lot of, sort of just anxiety about who's saying what and that could mean [crosstalk]-", "2150": "I mean, my family helps, my husband helps, my daughter helps. I have a support group at school that I can call, one or two friends from school that help. I have support groups in my community. I can tell one or two of my friends in my community about, [inaudible] the ideas off. And that helps as well. I started, I believe like one, that man, who said, \"I like Asians.\" I believe that one person can make a difference in a positive way. I've started to put a box outside my doors, so the essential workers, take what you need, take what you want and putting snacks and food and water to let them know that their work matters, you matter and you coming out and delivering my mail, my packages is important.", "2151": "And if only one person in the neighborhood puts out a box, then they're going to remember that our neighborhood, that with the New Brighton, there was somebody that cares. So I make sure to put nice things in it, but I noticed that they're not taking anything yet, but I'm going to continue to keep that box in there, out there. It says, \"Essential workers, thank you for what you're doing every day.\" So they know that someone in New Brighton cares that they're working for us. Deb, it looks like you're muted.", "2152": "Deb, I can't hear you, Deb?", "2153": "Did she leave?", "2154": "No, she's there, her lips are moving, but-", "2155": "You got to unmute yourself.", "2156": "She's muted. I don't think she hears me either. And I'm unmuted so that's really odd.", "2157": "Lower left hand corner, Deb, the microphone.", "2158": "The problem was, that I was like switching between twins and I was listening to everything you said, Leslie, but of course, because I'm a boomer, as my kids would say, I'm trying to get back to the main screen and it was hidden, but I knew you were there and I heard what you said. So yes-", "2159": "No worries.", "2160": "And again, it's, it seems like everyone's bringing up talks about being heard and being supported. Linda, did you want to say anything about the health of your community, whatever community that might be, your social community, geographic community and that sort of thing.", "2161": "I love the block that I live on, the street that I live on. We have such a diverse group of people, so many different cultures. And I like that, I like that in the neighborhood. And everybody seems to be very friendly towards each other. And when David goes outside, everybody says, hi to him. He knows people, he knows people walking their dogs, says hi to them. He knows the names of the dogs. The best investing is all the volunteers that we meet. They're a great group of people. I mean, everybody that goes there seems to have such a good heart and a good understanding of people. And they get a kick. When I'm at El Centro, using the Spanish that I learned more often. And I think that helps a lot. And I feel good being able to communicate with people like that.", "2162": "Well, I mean, thanks all for sharing the idea of feeling valued and connected and in your community and not having to be anxious about what kind of interaction you might have just based on what you look like. It sounds like you all have a lot of insight into that. So like now we've got about maximum like a half an hour left. And so there is, I'm just going to let you know what's on top, maybe we can take a few minutes to talk about the conversation, maybe as a way for you to think about raising your voice, outside and beyond this group. And for the last question, if you guys have some thoughts on one thing maybe you've heard today, from the conversation that you would like other people to hear, people who might be [inaudible], what seemed to be important for us to take away. And then just to wrap up, a brief wrap up, if you have any questions for us, and then Alex is going through an online survey after, if you guys could take about... How long is that going to be Alex?", "2163": "It's just, it will take some five minutes.", "2164": "So I guess this part is just raising your voices and thinking about what maybe you've heard today or something you can take away from it, whether it's like action or knowledge or whatever that might be, if anyone has some thoughts on that.", "2165": "I don't want to speak first because, as my wife is wanting to say, as a white male I'm in a position of privilege and people tend to listen to white males. My wife is more likely to speak up than I am. I've always been kind of an agreeable kind of quiet person, but she's helped me to see that there are times when you really have to speak up. And what is the quote, it's, \"All it takes for evil to succeed, is for good people to remain silent.\" It just takes one good person to speak up, I think, in the right situation and to be that catalyst. And I want to be more like that, I want to be more like Leslie. And I think you have to be on the flip side of that, you also have to be open to people's ways of seeing things as well, unless it's just pure hatred, and then maybe not be so open to that.", "2166": "Thank you, Tony. It sounds like taking those points of view and seeing how Leslie is active in it and thinking about action on your part [inaudible], is one thing that definitely takes me in a conversation, because it sounds like we all have similar insights into what seems like equity or prejudice or disparity, or any of those topics that David and Linda are working to mitigate as volunteers. And I'm just going to let anyone else talk about something they might've heard from this conversation, that resonates.", "2167": "I think your daughter is photo bombing.", "2168": "She gotten off and she's like mummy.", "2169": "Don't be shy came on in.", "2170": "Now we're talking about healthy communities. No, no, no, I'm totally, just sorry, this is called boundaries. Hold on.", "2171": "Nobody really mentioned mental health, which I think is kind of interesting because we've talked about health. We talked about relaxing and vacation and stuff like that, but I think it all does tie into mental health. And it's a largely unrecognized, I guess there's more recognition about the problems with mental health. Whenever I see another report about somebody jumping off the Verrazano bridge or I hear about somebody who's overdosed on heroin again, and saved, and I think about the plight of people who are experiencing problems with mental health.", "2172": "Well certainly a lot of people, a lot of people are struggling now.", "2173": "I think with being in the pandemic crisis that people, myself, I'll talk about myself, are suppressing feelings and just close quarters is 24/7 spending so much time with each other is a pressure cooker. So mental health is needed with that as well, how to cope with quarantine and disappointments. A lot of like summer plans have been canceled and stores have still not reopened and anxiety, are when, or if we're going to bounce back, I think many businesses will not reopen again. And it really makes... And just being, getting the virus too. That also is, that's like the most important anxiety things, am I going to get the virus? And or if I go out, will I get the virus, or if I attend this party will I get the virus and all the news media, this was the number one, number nine, eight, seven, not being able to go to the gym, not being able to go swimming. When am I going to be able to go swimming again?", "2174": "It's a big no. Our next door neighbors is a nurse. And she goes to work, he went to work this afternoon. He won't come back until Saturday afternoon.", "2175": "Wow.", "2176": "Yeah, he stays there and he only comes home on the weekend. And when he comes home, he goes right in the garage, strips naked goes to take a shower and change just into clean clothes.", "2177": "And people who take our blood. [inaudible]. They probably take 50, 60 people, they take their blood. I think those types of people, I don't, the essential workers should be getting hazard pay-", "2178": "Absolutely.", "2179": "And recognition should have to be made, hazard pay for that, putting their life, their health on the line. And that should be recognized. I wish it could, I don't know how.", "2180": "I thought there was a movement for that.", "2181": "There was, but it hasn't gone that far. There's like, I don't really... As an individual, I'm not really sure how much I could do except go to the hospital and bring food, but then you don't want to bring your own cook food because that's a hazard too-", "2182": "You can.", "2183": "I wish I could know on an individual level what I could do to help, I thought about it, but I didn't get very far either.", "2184": "I would keep away from hospitals. Don't go near hospitals.", "2185": "I mean, and I think like... I mean, when everyone's saying is so valuable and true, and they've been talking about all the mental health impacts and not knowing where it's going to end up as it's just such a moment that we haven't necessarily really ever even really, I mean, maybe imagined in some way, but like to live through it, to this extreme, in our generation, is something new. And so you wonder when we start coming out of quarantine, how people's mental health will be affected and what kind of supports are needed. And even if they have access to know how their mental health is affected, because I think a lot of people walk around not even realizing how they have like their whole mood.", "2186": "It might be different and their outlook and their anxiety level. And like you said, not to mention the economic crisis and everything. There's just so much, the gym, if people go to the gym, you're not getting out, for a while, no one should even get out of their house food, all of that stuff is, is tough. And then there's the community aspect of it too, you're going to go out in the world and who's wearing a mask, who's not wearing a mask, tah, tah, tah. I mean, and those are all public health questions that I guess we are going to have to face. And it's pretty heavy.", "2187": "We'll get through it one day at a time we're resilient as human beings. We're very resilient.", "2188": "And when you think about the world and how people have gone through so many crises, I mean, thank God we've been in a place where we haven't had to experience that in the same way, but people get through, and just going through is new. So anyone want to add anything else about, about like when the one thing you've heard that you're going take away or any questions that you might have, like closing thoughts any general reflections on the conversation, if you have any questions about this process and how, whatever you've said then maybe use to hopefully inform [inaudible], whatever, whether it be possible...", "2189": "So that you know the recordings are going to be transcribed, indexed, and eventually shared with, like we said, a journalists, public officials, participants and the Local Voices Network. And they'll also be shared with the city department of health. So I guess it's Alex, you're with the local voices network, but to spread the word, if you know anyone who else wants to do another conversation, we're trying to organize another conversation through Project Hospitality or in the next, before June 30th. So I've reached out to a couple of people, but I haven't really been able to get another conversation back. So if you think it's valuable and you want to put them in touch with me, that would be really good.", "2190": "I think you all have my email, and if you want... Or you can just go to lvm.org. And I have, anyone to add anything, questions, thoughts, insights, and then otherwise, I guess with that, I say, thank you for joining us. And then Alex is going to give a survey on screen after. So, I mean, before that anyone want to, I mean, I enjoyed this conversation a lot and it's, I think a lot of really important-", "2191": "Oh, thank you, Deb. I think you did a... You've been such great progress facilitating with us and making us feel comfortable and say, and acknowledging our feelings. So this has been a very rewarding experience. I'm glad that my voice matters and that it was recorded and hopefully this feedback will go back. And so it's been a very enriching experience. Thank you, Deb.", "2192": "Thank you. Thanks for being part of it. And I don't know if I'm overstepping my bounds as a facilitator, but who knows if it could be like, even a media campaign by the department of health maybe now after COVID fades, but just even awareness of that, and especially with this moment in time that prejudice or equal opportunities, or just transcends all communities and to have awareness of everybody I think at this moment in time, and historically it's always been looked at as a black and white issue, and we live in a world where it's not black and white and there are so many different people for whatever reason who felt the impacts of judgment and even Tony said, even as a white man these days, they're also judgments on white men who used to judge people, but that's your past. So again, maybe I'm overstepping my bounds, but it sounds like your ideas, public information campaigns to realize that all of us are valued. And I think that that might just generally help with mental health, anxiety, community communication, all of the sort of topics that we've talked about today.", "2193": "One time I saw this public health campaign of how Asian woman who was battered and that brought awareness, that is not just this person and that person, but meant all different types of people can get battered. And I thought that was a really effective like, \"Call this number, don't slap her in silence.\" I thought that was a really effective campaign.", "2194": "Okay, well, Alex.", "2195": "Just a huge... I'll turn on my camera. Hi, in my kitchen. Huge, thank you to all of you for participating, such a rich conversation you all had, and I'm posting a survey link right now in the chat box. So if you could all just take, just like five to seven minutes to fill that out, that would be a huge help us. As this work moves forward, feel free to turn off your screens. If you want play some music, whatever helps you fill out a survey. It's a really quick one. And I really appreciate you. I'm going to stop the recording right now as well.", "2196": "Okay.", "2197": "So welcome to this conversation of Cortico Local Voices Network and the New York city department of health and mental hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. We have started recording at this time and we're going to share a little information before we begin the actual conversation. Following the conversation today, the video will be discarded, but the audio was going to become part of local voices network online collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers and members of the media. And we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation.", "2198": "Our conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than being getting the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we'll be making the recording available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion.", "2199": "And Cortico is based out of MIT. That's where this is all rooted in. And then with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of LVN network. So use the recording in accordance with its mission and fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "2200": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website or be broadcast on a local radio station or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please share only what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. However, if you say something and then realize that you want that to be pulled back, we can redact it. So after the conversation, it hits you that you're not comfortable with something being public. You can bring that back because I know you're all going to be speaking from different ends. So if you understand and agree to this, I'm going to ask each of you to say I agree and we'll start with Esmeralda and then we'll go to Cecil, Crystal, and Althea.", "2201": "I agree.", "2202": "Cecil.", "2203": "I agree.", "2204": "Okay. Crystal.", "2205": "I agree.", "2206": "And Althea. Okay. Thumbs up. So she's like thumbs up. So we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation. And to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. One, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. Four, stay curious, ask honest questions. Five, pause, take time for reflection. Six, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Seven, when possible close unnecessarily programs, silence your phone and turn off notifications. So is everyone okay with these guidelines or do you think that we need to add any house rules before we begin? You guys can just shake your head. We're good?", "2207": "Okay. So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to keep this circle. So it'll be a Esmeralda, Cecil, Crystal, and then Althea. And I want you guys to introduce yourself with whatever name you want to use for this conversation. And just give us a little bit of background as to who you are, where you live and what you do. And if what you do impacts the Bronx, if you could highlight that because that's why I picked this group of people because I had a master vision.", "2208": "I'll go first to give you guys an example. And after you guys give your background, we want to share a value that's important to you and how that value is connected to why you agreed to join this conversation. So for me my name is Ramona. I live in Mott Haven. I am a social entrepreneur and a community activist or advocate and a value that's really important to me is community. And that's why I love participating in conversations like this. And I think that conversations amongst community really should be impacting how policy gets made. So I'm excited that the department of health is doing this. Okay. And then we'll go Esmeralda. Did she freeze on us? I think she might've frozen. Okay. Cecil, you can go and then we'll do the loo the other way.", "2209": "Everyone. Good morning. My name is Cecil and I live on 132nd street in the, I thought it was Mott Haven area, but I recently discovered it's Port Morris on some maps, first street in the Bronx. And I grew up on the same street too on Willis Avenue by 147. And I worked at SBS city government, small business services for my 9:00 to 5:00. Although I'm involved in a few Bronx focus groups for transportation and a few other causes. [crosstalk]", "2210": "Sorry.", "2211": "No worries. Value that's important to me is opportunity, being able to give people choice so they can live how they would like to, or so they can have their value their own values put out in the open especially in local communities, having people have choice or financial opportunity. That's a really big thing for me.", "2212": "Okay. And then we'll go with Crystal.", "2213": "Good morning everyone. My name is Crystal. I am not from the Bronx, but I'm very familiar with the Bronx. I work for a labor union and the building and construction trades and we represent over a thousand members and their families from the Bronx. One of the things that's important to us is local hiring. There's a lot of construction that happens in the Bronx and the bulk, I would say 90% of it is done non-union and a lot of those workers are not from the areas that these projects are happening in. And it takes the opportunity away from people from these areas to get these jobs. When you include labor standards into construction, you give people from these communities the opportunities to get on these jobs.", "2214": "And when they're union, it's not like once the job is over, they lose their job and this company goes away. Once they become part of the union, they stay in the union. And once this job is over, they'll be able to be placed onto another job. An important program that we had, which recruited NYCHA tenants into the trades. I was really proud of that program. All of the apprentices from that program graduated, it's a four year program and they were able to... So we took NYCHA tenants, recruited them into our training program and it was 98% minority and about 85% women, which is awesome because it's helping diversify the trades.", "2215": "Back in the day, yes, it was predominantly white male, but that's changing a lot, especially in my union. So that's something that I'm really proud of. And we're actually trying to recreate a second recruitment through the whole night NYCHA apprentice program. And we're trying to secure funding for that. So that's me and what I do.", "2216": "And your value? You spoke to it. But what would you name your value?", "2217": "I'm a little confused by that question.", "2218": "Like what's a value that's important to you?", "2219": "You talked about opportunity, access?", "2220": "Yes.", "2221": "So I guess those are the things that I would say that's a value that's important to me. Having access to a middle class income and a job that you could sustain a family on, especially in a city as expensive as New York. This career path is one that should be promoted and afforded to more people in these areas because it's one that you don't need to go to college for. You don't need to incur all of the student loan debt and you're able to make a really good living. And if you're in this industry long enough, you could even become your own business owner, have your own contracting company. So it's an awesome career path and the opportunity to have that is big.", "2222": "Okay. And then we'll go with Althea.", "2223": "Hi, good morning, everyone. My name is Althea Stephens. I'm a community leader and I work in the Mott Haven section, but I do activist and advocacy work throughout the Bronx. And I am always an advocate for young people. I'm a youth developer because I have a big belief in making sure that our young people's voices are being heard in spaces that they're typically not heard in, and making sure that they are present and they're there and they're included in the conversations.", "2224": "And one of my big community values is just community. What does that look like and how do we build our community together and how to community people's voices leave? Even with elected officials and things like that, how do we ensure that the community knows that elected officials work for them and not the other way around? So how do we get people to really understand that and really be the voice and guiding their communities, whether it's entrepreneurship, like you said, with the unions, making sure that union jobs are back in the Bronx, because we know that a lot of people benefit from that and that's how people get out of middle class.", "2225": "Also just how do we have community policing? What does that really look like? And that's not talking about police officers, how do we police ourselves and each other, and really build it up? And how do we have programming for young people so that they can develop into positive adults and really putting those values in the forefront?", "2226": "All right. And then Esmeralda.", "2227": "Sorry, I got disconnected.", "2228": "No worries.", "2229": "So yeah, my name is Esmeralda and I live right now, currently in the Morris Heights area. Let's see, what I do for work. I work with an organization where we run a social impact accelerator that supports entrepreneurs by providing both speakers, but a mentorship. But I think sometimes the most crucial funding we provide grants as small as $10,000, $5,000 to go to entrepreneurs. Let's see. And then the value, right?", "2230": "Yeah.", "2231": "I think for me, value is freedom. With freedom means that there is options. It's not like if you only got one, that's not, I don't know, I just always thought that that's not freedom. Okay, you just corner me to do one thing. I could either do that one thing or not. And I think that's what impact me to be in this conversation, impacted me to be part, even do the work that I do, because there are some resources for entrepreneurs in the Bronx for sure, no doubt, but can they be more? Can there be more options that people can choose from? And then all of a sudden it becomes multiple opportunities and I see the same even for the food that we eat. And the food is available to eat. So that's value.", "2232": "Okay. Thank you. So the next thing we're going to do is I want each of you to take a moment and think of a time, a place or a story that reflects when you were at your best, in terms of health and wellness, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What are some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time and how did you actually feel? So we're going to go around and we'll share our stories. Just remember that this is recorded. So if you do get carried away and need to pull something back, we'll be able to that after. But I'll share when I first felt the healthiest.", "2233": "For me, I always think of my time living in Hawaii in grad school and I was younger, I was tanner, I had access to better food, I did a lot of locally grown. The last place that I lived there, I had a mango tree. I had starfruit, I had Yuca, I was growing kale, spinach, I had my mini garden. I got to go to the gym five times a week because the gym there was $75 a year. My rent was only 825 for an amazing apartment. So their quality of life is measured more in what you do outside of your home while here, having a more expensive apartment, more things inside is what shows your status. There it's like, do you have flexibility to do the things that you love and that's how you demonstrate status. And that's the value there?", "2234": "So I always remember that time because although I've had autoimmune disorder for 20 something years, I couldn't manage my symptoms because my financial stress was lower, my quality of life was higher. I had access to outdoors and that improved my mental health. That environment made me feel healthy. It made me feel like I could do certain things to stay healthy. So that's always where I go when I remember, when did I feel the best? So I'll ask Cecil to get us started. I'm going to put it in the chat. So we're going to share when you felt healthiest, why and how it actually felt.", "2235": "Yeah. It's an interesting question. I feel like something that I go back to when I think of opportunity is thinking about my time out West a few years ago. Yeah, I spent a few years after school, a few months, a little under a year after school between San Francisco and Seattle trying to help other people organize the hippie life, a few dollars from college try to start a program. And I felt like even though I was bumming it for a while, it wasn't a regular 9:00 to 5:00, working a lot more. In some ways it's not really a clear boundary on shifts.", "2236": "I felt really good about being able to choose what I'm doing and also helping people who might not know about certain causes in the beginning, working with a lot of immigrants, the central American community especially, and helping other people to meet each other like hosting events. The weather helped a lot too, although San Fran is so cold sometimes. But yeah, I felt like I wanted to do that in New York. Eventually even though it can be much harder in some ways with all the people around and high cost of living. But yeah, I felt like really, really busy, but yet so at ease and I didn't have to worry about, which is a huge privilege, but not about finding the next thing.", "2237": "My school fortunately supported me and I also did some crowdfunding, try to get creative so I could stay as long as possible, but being able to have other people do that if they want. Not have to figure it out, like how do I pay my rent for the next six months? How do I make sure I have something to eat? How do I know what I'm crazy about? What I love to talk to other people about? So that felt really, really good for that year. Still figuring it out. That was a few years ago, like three years ago, not far out of school. I want to help other people and maybe do that myself like here in the Bronx.", "2238": "And it's interesting that you went from building a hippie life and now working with the SBC.", "2239": "Yeah. That's a good cover. It covers up the tattoos.", "2240": "All right. Crystal.", "2241": "When I felt my healthiest, I would say a lot of that for me has to do with my mental health. And I would say probably two to three years ago, I started to see a therapist and just being able to process and having the access to a therapist. So my job plays a big role in that, having health insurance and removing the stigma that comes with going and talking to people, because in a lot of our cultures is like you don't talk about your business, you don't talk about your problems and everything is kept a secret. And growing up with that, it's like you're holding on to so much. And finally just having the courage to go and to speak to someone about all these things that I've been carrying. And I've been able to process a lot on my own, but you can't do it all, right?", "2242": "I'm not a licensed mental health professional. So just having the courage to finally take that step and do that, and having the access to be able to do that, I think is important. It felt good. I felt like a weight had been lifted. I would say with three years ago, I really just started to focus on myself and my health. I have a 17 year old son, being a single parent is tough and a lot of that relationship with his dad wasn't the healthiest and just relationships in my personal life with my parents are not the healthiest. So there were a lot of things that I needed to process. And you don't realize how those things affect the person that you are and your personal relationships as an adult and being able to do that really helped me.", "2243": "But focusing on myself also meant living a healthier lifestyle. So starting to work out, I started to do... I hated running, but I started to push myself out of my comfort zone to be more active. I started to feel really, really good about myself. I started to feel more confident about who I am and in my skin. So I guess this is happening for me most recently, like in the past two to three years, and I'm continuing on that trajectory and it feels good.", "2244": "Yeah. It's interesting you bring up mental health because in the white community, having a standing appointment with your therapist is something you talk about, a happy hour, and you're like, well, I have my signing appointment and you're drinking your Cosmo and there's no stigma around saying I go to a therapist. And I constantly tell people I started therapy back in Hawaii just because there's no way to process fully without having a guided conversation with yourself.", "2245": "Absolutely.", "2246": "I'm constantly trying to send my family members to therapy and they're like, I'm not crazy. And I'm like, well, if you go to therapy, you won't become crazy, but we're on the road to crazy. So thank you for sharing that. And then we'll go with Althea.", "2247": "So for me, about two years ago I got really sick and I am a control person. So after I got sick, I was like, what the hell. I had pneumonia, I was in the hospital for seven days and my lungs were filled with liquid. And before that I had gained a whole lot of weight and I was at my biggest that I ever been in my life. And so for me, it was like, I need to take control back of my life because I'm such a giver and I'm always giving to everyone. And I had not taken time to really process who I was and I didn't realize how depressed I was. And so I really started a journey of really trying to get to one, know myself and then two, also just get to the layer of why I had gained so much weight.", "2248": "Why wasn't I working out? Why wasn't I meditating? Why wasn't I going to see a therapist and all those things? And so my hope was really about a year ago when I finished that journey, I lost about 80 pounds. I was meditating regularly. I was eating, I know... Ramona you didn't know me when I was super huge. I'm going to send you pictures. But just really getting to know myself and getting to a place where I was not just giving everything and not taking time to receive stuff for myself. And so that was literally my hope. I'm still on that journey.", "2249": "When I'm at my craziest, I'll stop and say, why am I feeling this way? You haven't meditated in the last week. You're not feeling well because you didn't express yourself the way you thought, because I'm also a person who things actually affect me physically. So even with all this stuff that's going on out in the world, it affects me physically. I feel physically sick, my stomach hurts, I can't eat.", "2250": "The outside world affects me physically. So I'm very sensitive. So I have to be able to stop and process and also decompress. So it's still a journey, but I'm still on that journey of feeling my healthiest, because I'm so much more aware of who I am, how I'm feeling, why I'm feeling this way, where these feelings are coming from. So it's just like a lifelong journey to continue so that I can make sure that I'm taking care of myself mentally and physically.", "2251": "And you're running for city council?", "2252": "I am running for city council.", "2253": "That's really good for your sanity.", "2254": "Ramona, but that's part of your fault too. Not tell our business. Part of your fault too.", "2255": "I tell all these people to run for stuff because I'm like, I don't want to run, but you should do it.", "2256": "Absolutely. She was like, yeah, because you should definitely run. Yeah, girl, I was like [inaudible], here I am.", "2257": "I'm sorry.", "2258": "She has all of her friends running. It does not even make sense. All of us are running for something.", "2259": "For something. I'm walking to the park.", "2260": "She like, yeah girl [inaudible]. But she does, she's very supportive.", "2261": "I do help. It's just that I don't want to run. So you should. But yeah, I don't know that you had lost that much weight. That's crazy.", "2262": "Yes. I lost 80 pounds.", "2263": "We met on the committee for Close Rikers. So by then that had happened.", "2264": "Yeah. That had already happened. And me and Ramona met and we did not like each other. Now we're good.", "2265": "At all. All right, Esmeralda.", "2266": "So I was born and raised in the Bronx and I love it. But when you ask the question of, when I felt my healthiest, I was a little sad that I didn't say at some point in the Bronx, especially having moved back home after living both abroad in a way, but that's the truth I guess. One point that I felt my healthiest was when I was living in Portland, Oregon, and this was after I had graduated from school and I have been working for maybe a year. And I felt so healthy because I don't know I had options. I was biking to work and I would bike 30 miles a day because it was safe. It was a bike lane and I didn't have to worry about car hitting me? And I could just take my sweet time.", "2267": "And I was walking five miles a day. So I was biking 30 miles walking for five miles, I was going to the gym because it was free. I could go to my school gym. Let's see, there was food options that were more organic and I could choose if I wanted to buy it. This one was the one that struck me the most. And it sounds, I don't know. I think gets me down a little bit something I want to think about it. But when I first went to a hospital in Portland, Oregon, I felt like I didn't belong there.", "2268": "It was so nice. I felt like somebody was going to tell me, I don't know, what are you doing here? I don't know why, and everybody just greeting me like, yeah, you're supposed to be here. How can I help you? What do you need? And it was just such a weird feeling because in all my time in the Bronx, obviously I think I grew up with not knowing how to fully utilize the health system. And then that comes from, immigrant parents who come from a different country and they may not know, maybe didn't have access to that and how to use that. And so all of a sudden I was using the healthcare system preventatively versus reactionary and I think it did shift.", "2269": "And so having all that access and all those options to do what I wanted to do goes back to my value, freedom. I love the outdoors. I love doing that. And here in the Bronx, I can barely go to my park without there being just trash everywhere. So I don't want to go. I'm not going to 7:30 at this park. And then what happens if you clean it? Okay. Then it happened again. And, I don't know. So I think that's when I felt my healthiest.", "2270": "Yeah. It's different how hospitals in different States feel like a customer service space versus you go here and Lincoln is by me in the times that I've had to deal with Lincoln because of my mom. it's just like a sense of, there's no competency I think. When my neighbor passed, I ended up having to go pick up his belongings and I was sent to three places to get the bag of the stuff that they were holding from when he was at Lincoln. And at each stop, I'm preparing myself to get his stuff and to deal with, okay, he passed away, this is all that left of him and I have to get this.", "2271": "And you build yourself up for that. And then they're like, okay, go down the left and make a right. And you're just like, holy shit. So it's just every stage of dealing with the health system here, with health and hospitals, I would say, is very demoralizing and it does make you reactionary instead of preventive. And that's why so many people just deal with the ER, I think, because it's just not somewhere you want to go. So thank you guys for sharing that.", "2272": "The next thing that we want to do is we want to talk about our concerns and we've touched a little bit on them and more importantly, the hopes that we have for health and wellbeing of our community. So for the purpose of this conversation I want you to think about community broadly. So that could be your neighborhood, the union members that you represent, the students at East Side Houses. And I want you to really speak about an experience that's related to the community and clarify which community you're discussing in your answer. So I have a couple of questions that's going to help us clarify that a little more, but first we're going to listen to a conversation that I hosted last week and Alex is going to play a recording from John for us. So let's give her a second to set that up.", "2273": "(Silence)", "2274": "Didn't come up. There it is. Okay.", "2275": "In public housing. Most of the time, most people of public housing... The first thing for New York City to be healthy is for adequate healthy food to be available for everyone, regardless of where you live and for it to be affordable, that is the key. You can go shopping like the young lady says, she goes to another supermarket outside of her neighborhood. She has to take a Uber, but is it always affordable to the people that live in public housing? Most of the time, it's not. Most people in public housing on, well, not most but there are people in public housing that's on a fixed income.", "2276": "So if you're on a fixed income, you have to budget that money correctly for that whole entire week based on your family or based on the month. Sometimes it's even based on date to date, which is even harder. That's a true hardship. So a healthy New York City would look like stores in our neighborhoods across the city that have healthy produce fruits and vegetables at an affordable price.", "2277": "So we'll reflect a little bit on what John just shared as to how he envisions New York if New York were to be healthy. And we all talked about when we felt that healthiest. Esmeralda mentioned, the Bronx is not the place where that definition or that sensation was rooted for her and it wasn't for Cecil and it wasn't for me. So if we were to try to change that, what would we have to lay out or ask for in order to make this a place where people could be like, this is where I feel my healthiest.", "2278": "And one of the questions you guys can reflect on is, what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resilience in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? And you could share a story from your experience that helps us understand that a little bit. Another question could be, if anything came to mind while you were listening to John, you could just reflect on what John said. So who wants to get us started with this one?", "2279": "I'll go.", "2280": "Okay. Althea has been twitching.", "2281": "We have conversations about this all the time of just how the Bronx was a food desert and even thinking about back when we were on the close Rikers Island campaign and we were doing all that stuff. One of the things we kept talking about was, can we get a goddamn supermarket that has food that's affordable and good. We were talking about why don't we have a Trader Joe's, why we don't have a Stewart Leonard. Why don't we have those supermarkets? So for me, it's one of those things where it's true. We talk about health and this microcosm of we need better doctors in healthcare, but it starts with what we put in our body. I talked about how I weighed so much and things like that. I gave the why to that weight from being in the Bronx.", "2282": "I don't have anywhere to go, but to the cushy free throws or to the Chinese restaurant or you can't get a good salad or whatever. So for me, part of that, our health is what we're putting our bodies and there's not a lot of options for us. And so that's one of my big pushes. I don't want to have to travel to Manhattan to go to a restaurant. Why can't I go down to the block and go to a nice restaurant? How do we make sure that we have quality food for our young people, quality food for our families? Even right now, East Side House, we have been working on this farm to food initiative where we are literally partnering with farms to get fresh food into the community during this pandemic.", "2283": "A lot of people are giving out food, but as processed foods and things like that. We need fresh food for this community, fresh vegetables, fruits and things like that. So it's one of those things that's very near and dear to my heart. Even when we talk about my young kids, and I run a bunch of after school programs with elementary school kids. We're teaching about farming, we're teaching about cooking and things like that because I keep telling people, we can't start the revolution if we can't feed ourselves. So we have to get to the place where we're feeding ourselves adequately, eating the right thing and having better diets.", "2284": "Yeah. And you said nice restaurants. What do you mean by nice restaurant?", "2285": "When you say nice restaurants, right? I'm here for having a diverse array of restaurants, but there's not a lot of places where you can actually go sit down and have a meal. One of the things that I'm always trying to have coffees and meetings, and I don't live in the Mott Haven section, I'm more up in the West Bronx. So we don't have a lot of restaurants. Literally I'm running for city council in district 16. We don't have any restaurants in that district. The only actual restaurant we have, they're small tops Dominican restaurants and things like that, which are great. But that's it, there's no nice restaurants that you can go to or have events at or take a meeting or even a coffee shop.", "2286": "There's a Starbucks.", "2287": "They're [crosstalk] having Dunkin' Donut, that's it. There's not even a Starbucks. It's Dunkin' Donuts, that's it. So I think we have to get a place when we're talking about bringing businesses, small businesses in here, what do they look like? And how does that reflect the community?", "2288": "And even when a Starbucks comes into a community like ours, 149th street doesn't have seating space.", "2289": "Right. And I want to be clear, I'm not advocating for a Starbucks.", "2290": "No.", "2291": "Much rather have someone from the community start a coffee shop and have that. I'm definitely not advocating for any more big businesses coming in. It's our community, it's supporting our community and taking our resources because that's part of the problem too, where we don't have money staying in our community, everything goes out of the community. We bring money in and everything goes out. So for me, it's like, how do we find and even Esmeralda, when she talks about the stuff that they do, and how do we connect more community members to those projects so we can start building our community ourselves and keeping money in the Bronx.", "2292": "And that's a really broad definition of what community needs. So the department of health is asking us to envision what does a healthier New York feel like or look like? And somewhere in the Bronx, there has to be more than just the department of health being able to provide the mental health, the weight management, the preventative medicine. Here we've lost so much and we're so behind that even who gets to open up a shop should be a health priority.", "2293": "But that's true. And thinking about our economy is part of our mental health. If you don't have money and you can't provide for your family, that has an effect on your mental being. And so that's part of it. So we can't just, and I keep saying this, one of the big things, we can't keep looking at short term solutions, we have to start thinking about longterm solutions and how is this going to affect us in 10 years. So we are saying that we need to build up our community and looking at it from a health perspective. We can't just say we're going to focus on mental health. We have to look at the whole person and the whole family and think about how this going to affect this family unit in 10 years. And let's build a plan to get them to the finish line.", "2294": "So I think some of it too was like we can't look at short term solutions anymore. And that is what we're known for. That's what government does. It's like, there was an incident, let's go over there and give them some money and they'll be fine. But next year you're like, well, how am I supposed to do that same program if I don't have funding and the cycle continues.", "2295": "Yeah. Crystal talks about employment, addressing economic disparities. And you're talking to how those disparities are also affecting our health negatively. So Esmeralda you come from a place of supporting entrepreneurs that are socially focused and then Cecil comes from the city side to push business success and entrepreneurship. Do you guys want to speak in any way to either what John said or how this gets shaped into health for our community?", "2296": "Yeah. When you first asked the question, I had to write it down back because I was like, I'm going to forget what I've seen, so I wrote it down. When you first asked what can we do to create your community as a place where you feel at your healthiest, and I'm sorry, but when I first thought about that, I was like, I don't know if we can get there. And it felt like I was asking for too much. So I'm asking for too much to say, well, I want a supermarket that just has organic produce in my neighborhood.", "2297": "I'm asking for too much if I want more parks and trees in my neighborhood, I'm asking for too much, if I want a bike lane that's closed off in my neighborhood in the Bronx. It just feels like you're asking for too much.", "2298": "Audacity.", "2299": "Yeah. It's not like, can we get there because we don't want it, but can we get there because other people want us to want it. So let me see. The other thing that I think about both in reflection what Althea was saying as well as the recording after John, [inaudible], was like, I think sometimes people think we don't do the research. I literally have gone on farmer's market. I got a map, I got to look at Google. I looked up so many places in the Bronx where I can go and find organic produce.", "2300": "And guess what, farmer's market is like, you can come to this market Wednesday from 1:00 to 3:00. Why is it only on Wednesday 1:00 to 3:00? Don't you now people got to work. Why would they cater to a population that that's not for us? That's some people working, even if you want it to go, it's just not accessible to go. And that's like [crosstalk]", "2301": "That's a really good point. I never thought about that farmer's markets or because I'm disabled I get to go. But you work a 9:00 to 5:00 and Althea, Cecil and Crystal do too. So if you wanted to get farm direct food in our community, you can't do that at six o'clock. [crosstalk].", "2302": "Te problem too is I have a car I can leave, right? That's part of it too, where I have conversations with folks who are like, well, if you have a car, so I can go to the farmer's market upstate on the weekends, or I even drive to Stuart Lennar's or Trader Joe's or some of of nicer restaurants. But that's not fair for people who don't have a car, who have to stay in the community. So that's the other problem.", "2303": "So for me, I'm like, we are doing the research, we are doing that part. I just feels like sometimes people don't think we want to be healthy. It's like well, what are we going to do if there is inconsistency in the options that we got. And once there's consistency, why would you go somewhere and someone's like, actually it's not open today. I'm not going to waste my time to go there again, especially if it takes me two buses or trains to get there or if it's not nearby or if... Again, I'm all for local businesses too, but then sometimes they'll list stuff there and you'll go, and there won't be organic produce or you got the soggy ass stuff. It's like, it's been done. It's not good to eat no more or it don't look appetizing, so what you're going to get?", "2304": "But there's a French fries.", "2305": "So what are you going to get? Then I think about some of the entrepreneurs that are in our cohort. Our last cohort, the two winners were centered around health. They're both from the Bronx... I think one's from the Bronx and one's from Harlem, but they both work and been investing in the Bronx. And we're talking people who one is yoga related and the other one is creating curricula to cater specifically to our spaces. So how can you get healthy when our goals look different, when our spaces look different. And so she catered to that.", "2306": "And I think about even the cohort that we got right now, some of the entrepreneurs are specifically looking at how do I teach farming to my kids so they can value it, to my inner city kids so that they understand. And I wish we had more funding to be like, you know what, we're going to help all of these organization get incorporated. But the way that we hand out the 10K is that we ask the community to rate one another. And so if the community feels like, you know what, this other issue is more pressing to me right now, this education issue is more pressing and I got it. And I can only vote for one, I'm going to vote for this one. And so it just means that we don't get to, I don't know, we don't get to pour entirely into our community by saying, \"Hey, we're going to put some funding into here.\"", "2307": "And also that pie of resources in the Bronx never gets expanded. So we have all these different priorities, unemployment, education, housing, food security, health, obesity, diabetes, now COVID. And even with all of that, if you think about it, the pie hasn't really gotten expanded and I'll feel was mentioning bandaid solutions, where we'll get a ton of food giveaways. And my grandma gets meals delivered and half of them are pasta. So the seniors in her building that have diabetes, they're like, I can't eat pasta every day.", "2308": "They're doing something that's supposed to be helpful, but because the resources aren't there, even they're preparing food that someone should not be eating every single day, which is pasta and meatball, full pasta and sausage, pasta and this. And I'm just like, I'm constantly taking her meals and creating a big salad to go on the side of it, but not everyone's having that conversation in their home.", "2309": "But I think it's even bigger than that, right? I'm a vegetarian and I know a lot of people who are vegans and right now they're struggling because they can't find food for them. If there's a food giveaway, that's not possible. And even a lot of the meals that they have, have meat in them. So people who are vegans and vegetarians right now don't have food.", "2310": "Yeah. And it clearly States in the cities info about the get food program that they don't cater to budgetary and kosher and other descriptions. So for the ease of producing the meals, they're just producing standard meals. But again, we have a huge population of immigrant Africans that are coming in that are Muslim. So if they're getting all of these meals, is it an inclusive plan if you're the resource for food security right now? The city and the department of health, and you're not providing those kinds of meals to the community. Crystal, did you want to say something? I saw you reaching.", "2311": "I was just going to say for me, I think two of the biggest things and Althea and Esmeralda, right?", "2312": "Mm-hmm (affirmative)", "2313": "They touched on it. It's I feel like it's accessibility and education. I think that when you know better, you do better. I also feel like there's so much information and there are some resources, but it's the extent of research that you have to do to even figure out where the resources are, how to get them, where they're coming from is insane. And not everyone has the skill or the knowhow of how to go about doing that research. So I think that the information is not really getting out to everyone. And then also you guys mentioned accessibility and when it comes to health, not everyone can afford a gym membership. You have a lot of these little boutique workout places, spin classes.", "2314": "And I go to one of them because I can afford one. That's what works for me. But not everyone has the opportunity to do that. So we're limited on green space and outdoor area. Not everyone can afford a gym membership or to join any of these places. So I think that's a huge thing too. How can we be healthy? How can we stay healthy when we have little to no resources to help people go about doing that in getting there. So I think that's a big thing that should be taken into consideration, the accessibility to gyms and workout spaces or green spaces and open area. Exactly. You just made me think of when I first came back, I had been sent to public assistance in order to wait for my disability. And St. Mary's Park has an indoor pool, they have a gym, they do classes and it's relatively cool.", "2315": "And I tried to get a membership, but on my public assistance allowance, I can't afford it. And they're like, well, no, you need to wait till disability. And then if you prove to us that you got the disability, then we'll give it to you for free or super discounted. And I'm like in my community, 50% of us are below the poverty level. So if this is a park owned by the city, why is the city not supporting me in having access? With my information, having an indoor pool all year long would change my life. And I had that in Hawaii. And that's how I kept my pain down. Having access to a cheap membership would change my symptoms. And I don't have a park in Mott Haven. I can hang out in the projects in my courtyard, but there's no park where I can go and I'm not trespassing.", "2316": "If you guys see my social media, I trespass all the time where waste management is because it's the only place with grass and trees. And that's why I get to walk my dog and where I do my walking. [crosstalk]", "2317": "Sorry. Even having access to a swimming pool, right? I'm a city girl, I grew up in the city. I never learned how to swim. That's an important life skill to have. Even for our kids to able to have access, to take swim lessons. I went on a vacation and I almost died. I came back, I freaking paid, I don't know how much it was. Maybe it was $200, $300 to take swim lessons at the YMCA, I'm still not a good swimmer, but I got the movement down. I got the basics. But even having access to that.", "2318": "So when I had my son, it was such a big deal that he learned how to swim. I was like, you are learning how to swim from a very young age.", "2319": "I still don't know.", "2320": "It's funny that you guys say that because... So I've run programs like I said, and last year I took my teams on a trip to Club Getaway, which is upstate. It had a pool. So in order for them to go into the Lake and do voting and all those activities, the water activity, they had to take a swim test. Out of 50 kids, I had three kids that could swim, that could pass that swimming test. What the hell is going? Why do you know how to swim? And they literally told me, they was like, miss you don't take us swimming, how else will we learn? And I'm like, wait, what? They're like, Althea swimming is not part of your program, where else will we learn it? And I was like, I have to take a look where it was like swimming isn't a part of it because we can't get insurance to cover us so we can't teach swimming. [crosstalk]", "2321": "And where would you take the kids from Mott Haven, right? Where is there a pool in Mott Haven? I have to go into [crosstalk]", "2322": "It isn't. So I had to bust them somewhere. And when I came back to my agency, I want to add a swimming component, they're like, we cannot find insurance, that's not astronomical to get these kids swimming. And they were like, where would we learn it? They were like, we are with you all summer.", "2323": "And who would teach it too. You need instructors. And a lot of people who pay for it, they have one-on-one... I used to go to the summer camp at St. Mary's when I was younger. And they used to have a swimming class, but that's one person watching 20 heads at the same time, hoping, I don't know how [crosstalk]. Yeah. So also I want to highlight the fitness piece. I'm in the green space because the Bronx is like the borough with the most green space, the largest parts, but a lot of that's going North. SPS, we were working on a project to try to increase fitness-based businesses. But it's so hard because the whole wellness space is, it's commoditized, it's turned into something like based on your class, you can have this fancy water bottle or you can pay to save money.", "2324": "It becomes a status symbol. And like Crystal said, there's no gyms in many places. Like Althea said, you need to account for all the logistics, you got to build your day around it. And like Esmeralda said, you really need to feel at a place where you're comfortable with it. Because I noticed a lot of people aren't, they don't have a choice in when they exercise, but they also don't feel comfortable with the idea of exercise. Because a lot of people from what I see, we think you have to be an athlete or a pro or you have to go lifting weights every day or biking 50 miles. And if you're not doing that, then fitness isn't for me or I don't feel like getting out of the house.", "2325": "Because they've never been in our machine, right? The first time I went to the gym in Hawaii, I was a freaking adult. I had gone to the gym a little bit at John Jay College, but I was just looking at other people feeling stupid because I had never been in a space where I knew how those machines work, then I knew what to do. And you're so embarrassed because you're like, all these other people seem to know what's happening. How do I break into this? And then, as you get older, you're just like, help and someone will help you. But our community also has a lot of self esteem issues that come from living in this environment. And that translates into how you engage, not only your environment, but a gym. That was really good. You guys kicked ass. That's why I wanted this group. Now you see it? You see my vision?", "2326": "Ramona one statistic, just this last point that I was having conversations with entrepreneurs. Could we meet every week? And we are digesting everything that's going on. And one statistic that I came to find out that I did not know. And I had to post to this group, people of color, majority of Bronx residents is that the Manhattan is literally only 15% larger population in than the Bronx. That's not much bigger than we thought. And the ratio of doctor to residents is to radically different in Manhattan than it is in the Bronx. In Manhattan, we got one physician to about 960 people. I might've forgotten the statistic by 100, but trust me, this stark is so in Manhattan, one to 960. In the Bronx is one to 1,960.", "2327": "That's about 1000 more people per physicians when in Manhattan is only a 15% of population increase. And at this I'm like are you serious? This is the drastic things that we're talking about. And then if we're talking about specific story of COVID-19, most of my entrepreneurs commented on the fact that we were promised a makeshift hospital, makeshift place to support, combat the COVID-19 and we didn't get one. And Manhattan got two or three. It's like nobody cares about us. [crosstalk]", "2328": "The first COVID-19 places we have were all in the North Bronx, which to me made no sense. The numbers shown that the South Bronx and the West Bronx was hit the hardest, but the first place that they put the testing sites were in the North Bronx and they were not accessible by transportation. You have to have a car and it was a drive through. So for me, it was very clear about who they were concerned about and who they wanted to get the testing for. And I think some of it, we have to start calling it out. That was a clear indication that you were talking to people who had money, who you felt needed to get tested. Because at the end of the day, we did not get a testing site in the South Bronx and in the West Bronx until three weeks after the outbreak, when the numbers started to decrease and we had already lost thousands of residents.", "2329": "This ship goes all the way to way down Manhattan. It could have met us all in the middle. It could have been right there in Harlem or something, but damn, I didn't know [crosstalk] about it.", "2330": "They kind of talking like they were going to turn Yankee stadium into a [inaudible] center. They have one in central park, all these other places, and it's like, y'all numbers are not even matching the Bronx, we're dying.", "2331": "And that's why I think our community is so complacent like Cecil was saying, you get to a point where you feel so beaten. And for our neighbors down here in Mott Haven and Port Morris and the middle Bronx, we all could see that. Right. And it was obvious that the decisions were being made excluding us. So then what incentive do you have to go to a hospital to seek care if the resources are purposefully keeping you out?", "2332": "And it's interesting too. Because even having conversations with residents who contracted COVID and their experiences at the hospitals were starkly different. If you went to a hospital in the South Bronx, and then you left and went to hospital in Manhattan, 100% different interactions, very different. Even now, it's just 100% different. And so we start addressing those things of how are our basic level of care is not being met. It's like, how do we then even move forward?", "2333": "Yeah. And health and human services really needs to start looking at that ratio. That Esmeralda just brought up because I remember when Louis was in the hospital, we were being told that every time that they would flip him, the fluid in his lungs would release and that he would get better, but they didn't have enough nurses to flip every person with COVID and they didn't have enough experience using all the experimental medicine. So they were just not capable of taking care of him.", "2334": "And I think something that I've heard in my community a lot is, a nationwide, we don't have the right number of COVID cases because a lot of them that have gone unreported. But I think that number is drastically different here in the Bronx, because people are scared to go to the hospital. I have people who have been like, I know people who know people who are like, yeah, they got COVID-19 and you know what they told them? Don't go to the hospital because they were like, I feel like if I go to the hospital, I'm going to die.", "2335": "That has been the rumor. If you have it, you might as well just stay home and suck it out because they're going to tell you that at the hospital. And if your situation is, I can't guarantee that they won't.", "2336": "Yeah. You're right. Yes. Another thing that I have forgotten was when you were talking about purchasing and that purchasing power. So the department of health wants to think about how do you envision these shifts? And you guys kept bringing up food security and access to the right meals. If so many of our neighbors are dependent on public assistance and food stamps, then we need to start questioning, why is my monthly allowance for food stamps $189 when we know that that's not going to make it through the month. So we're going to start-", "2337": "I was going to say that we also need to talk about why so many of our neighbors and people still need food stamps. When do we get to a place where we don't need to have people standing on line for hours for food giveaways, when we don't have people who are dependent on food stamps. And to see why is this still happening? Why does it seem like everyone around us is building up economics and building up wealth, except our community. [crosstalk]. You've already talked about it. We're not keeping money in our community, but how do we then start doing that?", "2338": "And we're not keeping jobs in our community either because Crystal, when she and I first started talking about this, I didn't realize the hardships that even union members deal with, with having something the borough. And why do I have all these men in my neighborhood that aren't from here building my community?", "2339": "On this journey, I found out that a lot of, especially with the affordable housing, they don't have union workers because they think they can't afford it. I'm like, really? How's that possible?", "2340": "And that's a good segue out here, because what we're supposed to do next is reflect on what struck you in this conversation. So if you could share one thing that you heard today that you're going to be taking away with you and that you think is important to other people here as well. Cecil, do you want to go first?", "2341": "Yeah, sure. It's not one thing, but it's so interesting that for most of us, if not all of us, our happiest moments was outside of the Bronx and trying to think of... And for most of us, it was the West coast, a little theme there. So wondering some of the lessons we can bring from that. And also labor. Financial opportunity matters to me, but with a union like construction and that whole topic, as a union member, I'm thinking of how a lot of stress and uncertainty, it seems to be related to how I'm going to make ends meet.", "2342": "And I'm before we can get to all of the nice things, having nice weather, vacation, hobbies, we need to make sure the basics are covered. And that seems to be so rooted in labor, what kind of job you have, what opportunities are in your neighborhood? We should be able to easily point to a place in the Bronx or a time in the Bronx when we feel nurtured. And the fact that it's so natural for so many of us to think of other places first that's something that's sticking with me.", "2343": "Okay. Thank you. What about you Esmeralda?", "2344": "I was trying to think, hey, was there new statistics and new information that I wasn't aware of? Unfortunately everything that we talked about or some things that I had a retinue because [inaudible] here. Everything that Crystal and Cecil and Althea and you Ramona was saying, it's true. We don't have the amount of money that's in our food stamps given to folks, is just not enough, and the list can go on and on. But I think the thing that I'm taking away then from that is the affirmation. My experience is not silly or valid. Because I remember a telling that statistics to somebody and someone gave me some stupid ass responses to why they needed more doctors in Manhattan and I was just appalled.", "2345": "I'm just taking away of knowing they are people, the community realizes, the community knows and the community such as you guys are affirming that these things exist. And so I'm taking that away with me.", "2346": "Crystal.", "2347": "Well thank you for including me in this Ramona, even though I'm not from the Bronx, but I spent a lot of time in the Bronx, especially when I was in high school. But I really appreciated hearing everything from all of you. I think everybody brought unique to the table and I see why you put us all together Ramona. Even though I'm not from the Bronx, I was born and raised in Brooklyn. A lot of the issues that you guys have in the Bronx, there's a lot of the issues that I had growing up in Bushwick and an East New York.", "2348": "And one of the things that happened to me that I feel like I won the lottery was I got one of those affordable housing lottery apartments. And that was such a huge deal because I was able to take my son out of the projects and to raise him in... Now we live in the North side of Williamsburg.", "2349": "Bless you.", "2350": "Bless you. I love that he's able to grow up in that environment because we do have access to different things. And it's like, yeah, I still worry about him, it's still Brooklyn at the end of the day, don't get it twisted. But it's just different growing up there, than growing up in the projects. I don't worry about him as much walking to the corner store. We do have a few parks in the area, but then it's still not as much as... One of the things I love about the Bronx is all the big parks and the green space that you guys have up there. But I feel like I lost my train of thought. Anyway, I'm just happy to-", "2351": "Housing security.", "2352": "... have been a part of this. So the housing security and just again, having access and opportunity is such a big deal. And I think that every single person here touched on that. And yeah, that's what I'm taking away from this. Just like everything that you guys said and just, I worked for a labor union. We have a lot of members who live in the Bronx, we're trying to figure out ways to push for them to have more employment opportunities where they live. And I think having the access to those jobs, it will be a game changer for them because they don't have to travel. [crosstalk] And when Althea mentioned the affordable housing, it's like, I call BS when the developers say they can't afford to use union labor because in this union and many others, we have different rates.", "2353": "So there's 8% rate. There's a market recovery rate that you can use. So it's still union labor, but we work with the developers, we work with the contractors because at the end of the day, the goal is to get as much work and hours as we can for our members. Because if they're working and they have access to this, then at least to them having a better quality of life. And they get all these tax breaks from the city and the state. So it wasn't all the money that you're saving on that, invest a little bit more and have some sort of labor standards on these projects.", "2354": "Wow. I didn't know that. Thank you. And Althea, what's your takeaway?", "2355": "I think one of the big takeaways. One, it was just really good to have this conversation with like minded people. And one thing that even Esmeralda has just said and we're just talking about was just how when you're in the work and you're in the trenches, you're tunnel vision. And so for me, I've been tunnel vision for the last couple of months, trying to push things along and get things done and running for office, still running programs, still trying to be a presence in the community because we're in so much need right now. So sometimes it's nice when you come along and you meet people who also are doing the work and doing the things in the community. And so for me, it's always, how do we continue to build this army, which we need so we can get the things that we need in this community done.", "2356": "So how do we continue to make connections with each other and make sure that we're uplifting this platform of each other so that the message can continue? Because I was having a conversation with someone last night and it was like, when this is over, that's it. And this was a young person. We just got to just let it be. And I'm like, I will never let it be. I'm going to continue to fight and push until I don't have a breath in my body. And so how do we get those young people back on to feel like they just feel defeated and it's nothing else that they can do. But I think part of that is us continuing to work together, have these conversations and actually putting those conversations into real plans to actually change and move things forward.", "2357": "That was good. So for me, I think the reason I wanted all of you together was because I didn't want the department of health to keep having conversations that weren't reflective of the conversations I have with each of you individually and how constantly gets defined as standards and metrics and illness and disease and cures. And New York city has so much infrastructure, community infrastructure, right?", "2358": "We talked about housing, we talked about education, we talked about green spaces, we talked about staying active, we talked about organic foods, gardens. There's all these things that need to be part of that definition of health. And I knew that you guys would bring them all up. And I hope that when they listen to this and they start shaping a plan for the communities that we talked about, that it's broader than health is normally described, because health should really be guiding conversations on wage. Health should be guiding conversations on farmer markets schedules, and it should be guiding everything if that's what we're trying to achieve.", "2359": "So I'm really thankful that you guys set the time for this. I know everybody's crazy busy but I thought that this would be a good grounding for all of us in the work that we all do. So thank you. And I just want to ask if anybody has any questions about the process about, about next steps, we can address those and then we'll wrap up.", "2360": "Yeah. Just a comment. You let that department of health know that they all need to come up with all the solutions either. We have social entrepreneurs, in the program I run in the Bronx, then it creates solutions already. It's to partner up.", "2361": "Yeah. Partnerships is definitely something that I believe in strongly. I just did intake yesterday with a senior center in DC and they're like, we really need you to write grants. And I'm like, we really need to look at partnerships and they're addressing health for seniors. And I'm like, there's an opportunity to partner with different sectors.", "2362": "There's no reason why the department of health shouldn't be supporting a union that's trying to maintain employment in the Bronx. And then shouldn't be also pushing from the other end saying if you're building affordable housing in New York, you have to hire unions because of what that means for the community. So thank you Esmeralda for bringing that up. Any other questions or comments before we wrap?", "2363": "Actually need to go because I have a staff meeting I need to jump into.", "2364": "No, we're done.", "2365": "Got to go. Waiting for me in the office.", "2366": "Just a huge thank you to all of you to chime in. This was a really amazing conversation, privileged to listen. If you want to click on the link to the survey that I put in the chat box before you leave the Zoom room, that would be great. Because this survey is also going to help the folks at the department of health unpack a lot of what was said in the conversations. So thank you so much.", "2367": "You guys click on it and then I'll send it to you guys as well. So thank you so much again, and I hope that this was fun. I love when my master plans kick in. So you guys have a good day. We'll talk soon.", "2368": "Thank you.", "2369": "Bye.", "2370": "Bye.", "2371": "Thank you, Ramona.", "2372": "No problem. Bye Alex.", "2373": "Bye.", "2374": "So, welcome to the conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. So, as you all know, this conversation will be recorded. And it'll be recorded but the video will be discarded. Audio will be kept for Local Voices Network and their website. So, the recording already began but I need to share a little bit of information with you before we begin our conversation.", "2375": "Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and audio will become part of the Local Voices Network conversation. There are three main purposes for our conversation today.", "2376": "First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each others lives. Second we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel in which we will lift up the voices and the needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers, and members of the media.", "2377": "To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experience with the health and wellbeing of your community rather than share any personal health information.", "2378": "This conversation is being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we will be making the recording available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "2379": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "2380": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in local newspaper or website or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So, please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public.", "2381": "If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\" So, go ahead and unmute yourself and if you agree to this, then say, \"I agree.\"", "2382": "I agree.", "2383": "I agree.", "2384": "I agree.", "2385": "I agree.", "2386": "I agree.", "2387": "I agree.", "2388": "I agree, too.", "2389": "I agree.", "2390": "And I agree. All right. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation. And to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're also on the materials that we've sent with the confirmation email.", "2391": "So, number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns. Four, stay curious. Ask honest questions. Five, pause. Take time for reflection. Six, listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Seven, when possible, close unnecessary programs, applications and notifications and put your phone on silent. So, you guys can take a moment and do that now.", "2392": "Is everyone on board with these guidelines or is there anything that you would like to add or change? You can let me know. If not, you can give me a thumbs up.", "2393": "I agree.", "2394": "Or, I agree. I agree works.", "2395": "I agree, I agree, I agree.", "2396": "I agree.", "2397": "Agree.", "2398": "Thanks.", "2399": "I agree, too.", "2400": "I agree, as well. I agree.", "2401": "Agree.", "2402": "Okay. Liam, if you can assist me, I want to just get a general order for the order portion of these questions. Like, figure out a quick list of who would like to go first, one through six.", "2403": "I could go last.", "2404": "Okay.", "2405": "I would like to go first.", "2406": "I'll go second.", "2407": "Okay. Hold on guys, sorry. We have eight people, including Richard and myself. Correct?", "2408": "Yeah. So, I'll start, as the facilitator, I'll start the conversation. I'll lead with an example and Liam, if you want to, you can either follow right behind me or you can wrap it up last.", "2409": "I'll go last then. So you go first and I'll go last?", "2410": "Okay. All right.", "2411": "And that way, we'll keep in mind that we have a timeline. Is that okay?", "2412": "Yeah, yeah, that's fine. Mike Burg, I see you raised your hand.", "2413": "Oh, I said I will go second.", "2414": "Okay. Mike Burg, second. Who wants to go third?", "2415": "I want to go third, Liam.", "2416": "Okay. Michelle. Then let's get a guy.", "2417": "I'll go fourth.", "2418": "I'm going to go fifth.", "2419": "Ashton, fifth. Daniel, did you say you want to go fourth? Who was that that said they wanted to go fourth? I'm sorry.", "2420": "I said, I'll go fourth.", "2421": "Okay. That was Shikar.", "2422": "Yeah.", "2423": "Okay, Shikar is four. Ashton Lambert will be number five. I feel like I'm making a baseball lineup.", "2424": "Yeah, my favorite number's two.", "2425": "Oh, good to know, Michelle. And then how about Josue and then Daniel? Josue, number six. Daniel, siete. Numero seite. And I'll be number eight. I'll be ocho.", "2426": "Thank you so much, Liam.", "2427": "Alrighty.", "2428": "All right. Okay. So, for the ease of this virtual conversation, we're going to use a modified circle process, which each person will take a turn. So, we've already figured the order.", "2429": "I'm going to go ahead and put everybody on mute and then if you want to take yourself off mute, you can do so, okay? That way there's no background noise. Thank you.", "2430": "All right, if no one has any questions to begin this process, to begin, we want to do a quick round of introductions. So, for this introduction, please share just your first name or pseudonym. And in addition to your first name, you can share a little bit of background information about who you are, where you live, what you do, as far as work or what you did before the pandemic happened, and a value that is most important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today. All right? So, first, I'll start this round.", "2431": "My name is Richard, or you guys can call me Rich. I am a Marketing Specialist/Job Developer for Young Adult Institute. I live in the Bronx and I work out of the Bronx and Westchester. And a value that's important to me, I wrote this down, is open-mindedness. I think that's important, especially now a days, for two things. Open-mindedness promotes learning and it also promotes correction. If you have an open-mind, you'll be open to receiving correction and the right kind of correction.", "2432": "So, we'll go with the next person.", "2433": "Next up should be Michael Burg.", "2434": "Okay.", "2435": "Yeah, Mike, just a quick introduction.", "2436": "Okay. Hi, my name's Michael Burg. I've worked with YI [inaudible 00:09:31].", "2437": "Would you like to share where you currently live or [crosstalk 00:09:40].", "2438": "I live in [inaudible 00:09:44].", "2439": "Okay. And what is a value that brought you here today?", "2440": "What is a value?", "2441": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "2442": "My value is that I learned a lot from Job Club.", "2443": "Okay. What's something you'd say that you learned, during Job Club? What's the value? Nothing that's related to work. What's something that's... or, you know what? It could be related to work. But what's something that you hold valuable to you?", "2444": "My skills.", "2445": "Okay. Okay. So, your value is a skill that you have.", "2446": "Yeah.", "2447": "Okay. All right, thank you, thank you. Liam, do you mind calling who's next?", "2448": "Michelle [Wensmead] is number three. Followed by Shikar, number four.", "2449": "Okay.", "2450": "So, I am up now, Liam?", "2451": "Yep.", "2452": "Okay. Hi everybody. My name is Michelle. I'm from the Brooklyn Job Club and I live in Brooklyn and technically I work for Shake Shack, in the city on 86th [inaudible 00:11:21]. And my experience is that I've learned a lot from the Job Clubs where I've had a lot of jobs in the past, but I've had help from the job coaches and now with their help, with the job coaches, I'm able to keep my job, and I'm still working at Shake Shack.", "2453": "But the pandemic, right now is really hard for me, is because with everything being expensive now, with me being out of work right now, money has been very hard for me since the supermarkets are going up, everything is going up, gas is going up. So, I'm able to go to the food pantries to get food, for now.", "2454": "Okay. Great.", "2455": "Until I return back to work.", "2456": "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "2457": "You're welcome. Is that all I have to say right now?", "2458": "Yeah, until the next section. Thank you.", "2459": "Okay. I'm going to put myself on mute.", "2460": "Okay. All right. Shikar?", "2461": "Hi, I'm Shikar. I'm from the Bronx. I'm currently unemployed. I'm learning some new things from Job Clubs, how to better more my skills and then try to learn new things and the opportunity job fields.", "2462": "Okay. Wonderful answer, Shikar. And what is a value that you hold important to you that brought you here today?", "2463": "People learn new skills and just try to learn some new stuff, how to maintain a job, permanently, that's it.", "2464": "Wonderful. Wonderful. Liam, who are the next two people?", "2465": "Next up, we have Ashton Lambert followed by Josue [Noreston 00:13:17].", "2466": "Okay. So, Ashton, you're up and then Josue, I'll take you off of mute, okay?", "2467": "Hi everyone. My name is Ashton. I live in Burke for many years, with my mom. And, mine is responsibility. I'm responsible for everything that goes on at work. I get along with people very much.", "2468": "Good, good. I like that. Anything else you'd like to add?", "2469": "I get along with everyone at work. It's really nice. They're like family to me.", "2470": "Oh, that's good. That's good.", "2471": "And because of the pandemic, I'm out of a job.", "2472": "Understood. Have you been working there for a long time? Is that why they're close to you?", "2473": "Yes.", "2474": "Okay. That's good. Thank you.", "2475": "You're welcome.", "2476": "Okay. Josue, I'm going to take you off of mute, all right?", "2477": "Yeah. [inaudible] I live in Brooklyn. [inaudible] services. I work at YI, I work there for 4 years since 2016.

Help people out. I'm a communicator. I greet people, like you. And ones I like to help out is someday I would like to cover classes, cover as many classes, [inaudible] he also-", "2482": "Can you repeat that one more time? What do you do on Sundays, Josue?", "2483": "Oh, I go to church. Oh, [inaudible] church. And [inaudible] program twice a week. Well, due to the pandemic, my [inaudible 00:16:52].", "2484": "Okay.", "2485": "And [inaudible] on Thursday and a Saturday but I go on a Saturday. One thing I do there is I chill out, [inaudible] communicate with friends.", "2486": "So, yeah. It's tough losing all those things. All right. Thank you, Josue. All right, next up, number seven is Daniel [Ramos 00:17:28].", "2487": "Richard?", "2488": "Yeah.", "2489": "Next up is Daniel.", "2490": "Yeah. I think he... okay. I have him as unmuted now.", "2491": "You're having some technical difficulties, buddy?", "2492": "I was taking a nap. I [inaudible] a nap.", "2493": "Okay. So, Daniel.", "2494": "Yes, Richard?", "2495": "Can you give me a brief introduction?", "2496": "About what?", "2497": "Yourself.", "2498": "Huh?", "2499": "First name.", "2500": "Daniel.", "2501": "And which borough are you representing?", "2502": "Queens.", "2503": "Queens?", "2504": "Queens.", "2505": "Okay. First Queens participant.

And what is a value that you hold important to you that brought you here?", "2512": "Can you be more specific, Richard?", "2513": "All right. What's something that you tell yourself everyday, when you get out of bed? Something that motivates you.", "2514": "Food.", "2515": "Food.", "2516": "Yeah.", "2517": "I have to chime in. Daniel, if you weren't snoozing, you would have heard what everyone else said. Something you value and just think about what do you value in life?", "2518": "My health.", "2519": "Your health. Okay. You know what? That's a good answer. So, that's why you eat and that's why you like food. It all makes sense now. Thank you.", "2520": "All right. Okay. So, thank you everybody. And Liam, I believe that's last.", "2521": "Yeah. I'm going to go number eight.", "2522": "Hi guys. My name is Liam. I live in Queens. I work for YI doing marketing and job development for people that I support. And something that I value every day is... I don't know. A lot of things have changed in the past couple months, so it's interesting to think about those kind of things. But I guess I value my family and my health. And also I heard communication, and being able to communicate with people in good, positive ways, is what I value. If we have to think about things like [crosstalk 00:20:55], I would say, family, health and communication, being able to talk to people.", "2523": "100%, I definitely agree with that. Especially in a day and age where, unfortunately we can't see people face to face anymore. We can't have those physical interactions, or as many physical interactions as we did three or four months ago. Communication's definitely important. Thank you Liam, that was a good wrap up.", "2524": "So, moving on to the next section. I'm sorry, was there a question?", "2525": "Yes.", "2526": "Yeah, go ahead.", "2527": "Liam, I forgot to mention one thing. Liam?", "2528": "He can't hear you.", "2529": "I forgot to mention one thing, Richard. Also, I'm a YI artist, as well.", "2530": "Oh, you're an artist?", "2531": "Yes. Right now, during this whole pandemic thing, right now, since the COVID-19 has been happening, I've been pursuing my artwork and I'm in a lot of art shows.", "2532": "Okay. Thank you. Thank you for your edit, there. All right. So, the next thing we would like to do is to invite you to share a little bit about yourself. We'll be talking about health and wellbeing. But we're going to incorporate what's been going on for the past couple of months, during the pandemic.", "2533": "It doesn't feel like a couple of months. It feels like a year!", "2534": "It feels like longer than that!", "2535": "Yeah, it feels like [inaudible] than that, Richard.", "2536": "That's true. That's true.", "2537": "I just need to hurry up and do this because I've got to eat soon.", "2538": "Understood, understood. So, moving right along.", "2539": "All right, I'll be right back, okay, Richard?", "2540": "Okay. All right.", "2541": "I'm sorry.", "2542": "Yeah, [inaudible 00:22:56].", "2543": "I wanted to say, if someone has to get up and use the bathroom or make a quick phone call, Richard, and it's not their turn, is it okay if they just step out with their microphone muted?", "2544": "Yes. Definitely. Yeah.", "2545": "You hear that guys?", "2546": "Yeah.", "2547": "If it's not their turn, yeah, absolutely. Okay. So, moving right along. We'll be talking about health/wellbeing today and I'd like you to just take a minute and think about what health/wellbeing has looked like, for the past couple of months during this. So, let's think of a time where, during this pandemic, where you felt at the best, as far as health. And what changes have you made for yourself, personally, during this pandemic. So, I'll start things off.", "2548": "As of recent... and I know I've discussed this before. As of recent, I've discussed how dietary changes, my own personal diet, as going, transferring to not eating as much meat and going completely meatless, has paid dividends for my health. I used to be sick every year when I was a kid and that stopped, literally the past year and a half that I've been eating completely healthy.", "2549": "But the second part of that, over the past couple of months, what I've been doing is, I've been taking a lot more precaution with disinfecting foods that come from outside of the house. So, what does that look like? Fruits, I'm soaking them in lemon juice, vinegar, anything that I know is-", "2550": "Sorry, Richard. I'm back.", "2551": "Oh, welcome back.", "2552": "Sorry, I just had to go get something for my mom.", "2553": "Okay. That's fine. I'm going to put you on mute now until it's your turn to-", "2554": "Also [inaudible] if you do step out, you don't have to announce when you step back in, okay? You don't have to [inaudible] know, okay?", "2555": "But yeah. That was, actually perfect timing. I was right at the end of what I was going to say. But yeah, lately, what I've been doing is just paying a lot more attention to disinfecting the foods. Just because it's important that as contagious as this virus has been, it's been very important to now take any precautions with anything that comes from outside of the house. And that goes for people who step inside of the door, too. Anybody who comes in, we try to do a disinfectant. Not that we've had any visitors anyway. But that's the policy, if you step outside of the house, come in, I'm sure everybody has done it. You just do a quick disinfect of the body. So that's it for me. And we'll go with who's next.", "2556": "Number two is Michael Burg.", "2557": "Yes, that's me.", "2558": "Michael Burg. So, basically the questions is, give me an update on what things you've done for your safety and health over the past couple of months and think of safety and health for you.", "2559": "All right. [inaudible] I've been doing for the pandemic, keeping wearing my mask and gloves and I keep washing my hands and make sure that I won't get sick.", "2560": "Okay. So, would you honestly say that over the past couple of months, you've increased the amount of times per day that you've washed your hands?", "2561": "Yeah.", "2562": "Okay. Okay. That makes sense.", "2563": "[inaudible] pandemic, I've been doing while I was working at [QEC 00:27:00], [inaudible] I got infected.", "2564": "Okay. And correct me if I'm wrong, you still work there, now, right? You haven't been furloughed or anything, you still have regular shifts?", "2565": "I haven't heard from my job yet, from QEC yet.", "2566": "Okay, okay. So, you haven't... okay, okay. All right. Well thank you. All right, next?", "2567": "Next is Michelle Wensmead, number three, followed by Shikar, then number five is Ashton.", "2568": "Okay.", "2569": "Michelle.", "2570": "I'm here.", "2571": "All right. So think of health and wellness. Think of a time that you've felt your healthiest over the past couple of months and what changes have you made over the past couple of months to just be a little bit healthier?", "2572": "Well, the changes I've made for the last couple [inaudible 00:28:07], I've been wearing my mask every time I go out. And I've been sterilizing my hands and washing my hands and basically doing a lot of things that I often do. Like, when I do a lot of walking, I make sure I wear my mask at all times and it's just rough right now. Being out of work right now is tough. So, I'm hoping to go back, hopefully I'm going to hear something after Monday.", "2573": "Awesome.", "2574": "Because I do a lot of things at Shake Shack, you know what I mean? I'm a greeter, I have to wash my hands all the time and wear gloves all the time.", "2575": "Okay. Is there a time that you felt the healthiest over the past couple months? Was there a time that you felt your healthiest?", "2576": "I'm feeling okay so far. You know, this pandemic has just been tough, but I'm all right.", "2577": "Great, great.", "2578": "I've been pursuing my dreams and doing what I have to do.", "2579": "Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.", "2580": "And we're working with my mom.", "2581": "Wonderful. Okay. And I believe Shikar is next. Right?", "2582": "Yeah.", "2583": "All right, go ahead, take it away.", "2584": "For me, I've been being out of the house, running around, doing errands, getting some exercise and stuff like that. Getting me some air, just staying cooped up in the house and [inaudible] with people in the neighborhood and stuff like that.", "2585": "Okay. All right. And what was a time that you felt like you were your healthiest over the past couple of months?", "2586": "By eating the right type of food in my system.", "2587": "Okay.", "2588": "Stuff like healthy stuff in my body, [inaudible] lifting weight and everything. Because at the time, I wasn't eating right. I would just try to eat all the bad stuff. And now I'm trying to eat stuff that is healthy in my system so I can live longer and stuff.", "2589": "Amen. Sounds good. All right, thank you. All right, Ashton.", "2590": "Yes.", "2591": "All right, take it away.", "2592": "I've been doing okay. I've been doing my stretching every morning. I eat lettuce, corn and tomatoes and I go to the bank to take out the money [inaudible] the pharmacy to get medicine for my face. And I've always been taking care of my bird. He's an African Grey, his name is Ross, he's right here.", "2593": "Yeah, can we see it?", "2594": "Can you see him?", "2595": "Oh man. That's beautiful. That is... yeah! How old is he or she?", "2596": "Five. He's five years old.", "2597": "Five years old. Wow. Beautiful.", "2598": "That's a beautiful bird [crosstalk 00:30:54].", "2599": "Yeah, yeah. I used to own a bird.", "2600": "What is that bird?", "2601": "He's an African Grey.", "2602": "That's pretty cool, because I used to own two of them.", "2603": "You used to own two of those exact same bird?", "2604": "Yep! I used to own two of them.", "2605": "Okay!", "2606": "A while back, but I had to get rid of them because I had little kids here at the time and it was biting my niece.", "2607": "Okay, okay. Thank you, Ashton. Was there anything that you wanted to add?", "2608": "No.", "2609": "No? All right. All right. Liam, who's next?", "2610": "Next up is number six, Josue. Sorry. Number six is Josue.", "2611": "That's fine. I understand you're very busy at home. You have a child. That's fine. Go ahead, Josue.", "2612": "[inaudible] since I've been not working for a couple of months. All's I've been doing is just chilling out. Sleeping, eating some food. Watching TV.", "2613": "As long as you stay inside, you're being safe, right?", "2614": "That's it.", "2615": "I agree, I agree.", "2616": "Yeah, it was. At first, I didn't want to go out. I didn't want to go out at first. But my mother was bugging me, telling me... of course, I had to go out with her. I had to go out with her to do her errands.", "2617": "Okay. Okay.", "2618": "Yeah. And my [inaudible] a little shopping. [inaudible] my church, [inaudible] my church, move some boxes of food [inaudible] juice, stuff like that. And orange juice. [inaudible] that was the box, it was sent by the government, because I couldn't go to my church, my church was closed, due to the pandemic. Now, they have reports that some churches are going to reopen. But in Phase 1 and Phase 2, some [inaudible] congregations can come [inaudible] and houses of worship. And one thing I would add is that, [inaudible] pandemics, why are they on the news? [inaudible] at least temporary. At least temporary, yeah.", "2619": "Okay. Thank you.", "2620": "Yeah, until we get this done. Until everything returns back to normal. [inaudible 00:34:14].", "2621": "All right. That's cool Josue. Very good. All right, next up is Daniel Ramos. Daniel?", "2622": "How you been, Richard?", "2623": "Good. Daniel, what sort of things have you been doing, as far as health and wellness, keeping that in mind?", "2624": "I've been exercising inside, keeping my body in form as always.", "2625": "Okay. You been playing basketball inside?", "2626": "No. I can't play basketball inside.", "2627": "Okay, okay. So, You've been exercising other ways, right?", "2628": "Keeping my body nice and healthy. I've been eating nothing but fruit and vegetables.", "2629": "Nice, nice.", "2630": "And tofu.", "2631": "Tofu? I love tofu. I eat tofu. I eat a lot of tofu.", "2632": "Tofu is one of the healthiest thing. Has nothing. No meat, no nothing at all.", "2633": "I agree, I agree. I love tofu.", "2634": "Yeah and besides, I'm a vegan.", "2635": "You are?", "2636": "Yeah.", "2637": "Same here.", "2638": "It's hard to resist the meat.", "2639": "Oh, it isn't for me.", "2640": "Oh, [inaudible] some people cave in.", "2641": "Yeah, that's true. That is true.", "2642": "I've been a vegan since I was a little kid, so I got the hang of it.", "2643": "Oh, you've got me beat, you've got me beat. So when, over the past couple of months, have you felt the healthiest? And I know you've felt healthy all your life, but when can you say, over the past couple months, during this pandemic that you felt like your best?", "2644": "When I'm eating fruits and vegetables and a salad, fruit salad, drinking my protein shake.", "2645": "Okay. Sounds good, sounds good.", "2646": "Yeah. This body doesn't keep it nice and healthy by itself. You need to keep [inaudible 00:36:20].", "2647": "Well, damn.", "2648": "I agree.", "2649": "Well, damn.", "2650": "I agree.", "2651": "Yeah, because I try to [inaudible] my body to be healthy [inaudible] the most.", "2652": "I think Josue is trying to call you, Daniel.", "2653": "Yeah, tell me something.", "2654": "Yeah, yeah. You're a vegan, huh?", "2655": "Yep!", "2656": "When did you stop eating meat?", "2657": "Huh?", "2658": "When did you stop eating meat?", "2659": "When did I stop eating meat?", "2660": "Yeah, yeah. When did you stop eating meat?", "2661": "Since I was a little kid, technically.", "2662": "Since you were a kid. How old?", "2663": "Yeah, it's not easy.", "2664": "Yeah. So, you don't eat no beef or chicken or beef or the pork?", "2665": "No, I don't eat no pig, no pork, nothing. No meat at all. I'm a vegan.", "2666": "Oh, right, right.", "2667": "Vegans don't eat nothing that comes from an animal.", "2668": "Oh, you try to stay slim and fit, right?", "2669": "Yep. Since I was a kid, they put me to the extreme. Any other questions?", "2670": "Yeah.", "2671": "I do.", "2672": "Tell me.", "2673": "Do you eat pizza, Danny?", "2674": "Huh?", "2675": "Do you like pizza?", "2676": "Nope.", "2677": "Well, sorry, too bad. I'm eating a yummy [inaudible 00:37:45].", "2678": "That's not a question, that's a statement.", "2679": "Huh?", "2680": "You don't eat dairy, right?", "2681": "Nope. Nothing that comes from an animal. [crosstalk] pizza comes from an animal.", "2682": "No it doesn't.", "2683": "And what was the next [crosstalk]", "2684": "The cheese comes from an animal. [crosstalk] what does cheese came from, then? What did cheese came from, anyway? From cows!", "2685": "Yeah, from cows.", "2686": "You can have pizza without cheese, Danny.", "2687": "Yeah, I don't like pizza, regardless. I don't like pizza.", "2688": "Okay [crosstalk]", "2689": "I eat pizza. I eat meat.", "2690": "Yeah. For me, nah.", "2691": "Oh, okay.", "2692": "Not even milk? You don't drink milk?", "2693": "Who said that? Who said that?", "2694": "[inaudible] milk, right?", "2695": "Mm-mm (negative).", "2696": "What do you drink?", "2697": "I'm eating pizza right now. I'm sorry. I have to eat because I'm hungry.", "2698": "One question at a time, please. One question at a time.", "2699": "Yeah, so all the questions are pretty much related. And I think you answered it all by just mentioning that you're a vegan, who does-", "2700": "Yeah, because [crosstalk 00:38:57]. Instead of buying my own... what's that called, protein shake, I just make it from scratch [inaudible] adding the milk.", "2701": "I know the process. I know the process. Well, thank you Daniel.", "2702": "You're welcome.", "2703": "Liam. Did you want to wrap up that question?", "2704": "In the past couple of months, what's been healthy or important, well, as Richard knows and a couple of you guys know, I like playing basketball a lot. And New York City put down the basketball rims, right when the weather was starting to get nice and when I was able to play outdoors. And even indoor gyms, obviously, were closed. So, it was hard for me to exercise and stay healthy once basketball stopped. So, I've been running. I'll go out on my lunch break and I'll run and that's when I feel my healthiest, is when I exercise during the day.", "2705": "Eating healthy for me is a little challenging, because sometimes it's just easier to just eat unhealthy food [crosstalk] affordable. But we've been cooking at home a lot and trying to eat more fruits and vegetables as well. So, a lot of what was previously said is what I have been doing as well. [inaudible] exercise [inaudible 00:40:23], whether it be running or doing some pushups because I can't play basketball, unfortunately, because New York City took down all the basketball rims and I don't know when they're going to put them back up. So, I've just been running and trying to stay active as much as I can during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "2706": "All right, thank you, Liam.", "2707": "Richard.", "2708": "Huh?", "2709": "Besides, I have a basketball of my own.", "2710": "Richard, I hope we do another fundraiser again with basketball.", "2711": "We should. Liam and I are going to start talking about that that once everything clears up.", "2712": "Are we going to go back to the church in Brooklyn, like we did, Liam?", "2713": "Richard, are we going to go back to the one in Brooklyn?", "2714": "[crosstalk] that. That's all up for debate. But that is something that we're going to have to talk about at another time, Michelle. But I'm glad you're interested.", "2715": "Are you kidding me? I did a great job, last year.", "2716": "It says, \"Brooklyn honored my basketball.\"", "2717": "All right. What else is next, Richard?", "2718": "All right, so, thank you everybody. We want to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in our community.", "2719": "So, I have mainly a question, to start us off. And we hope that there'll be some back and forth among you, as you share your stories. But of course, we'll try and have some order to that. So, for the next part of the conversation, we'll move from the format of taking turns speaking, to a more natural back and forth conversation, with a little bit of order. So, we'll still have the regular order, but we want to encourage more open conversation.", "2720": "I invite you to respond to the folks that resonate [inaudible] when they are made my others in the group, being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so.", "2721": "So, the main question that they had for us was, what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What I'd like to change that to, because we've kind of touched base with that, or we kind of went over that already.", "2722": "What are your hopes and concerns following the COVID-19 era? What are your hopes for the job markets opening up? Are you hoping that there would be a drastic change or are you looking for things to [inaudible 00:43:04]. There's no right or wrong answer. So, feel free to speak your mind and on how things were before and how you see things moving forward [inaudible] the COVID era. All right? So, we'll start off with, who has their idea after me, because... Michelle.", "2723": "I do.", "2724": "Okay. So, Michelle, were you before Mike?", "2725": "[crosstalk] the correct order is Richard... I'm sorry. [inaudible 00:43:38]. It goes, Richard, Michael Burg, Michelle, Shikar, Ashton, Josue, Daniel and Liam. So, Richard's batting first. Michael Burg's batting second. Michelle's batting third, Shikar is at clean-up, number four. Ashton is number five, Josue, the heavy hitter, is number six. Number seven is Daniel and I am number eight.", "2726": "You know what, Liam. Actually one thing I saw guys do in the past, if you can actually type that in the chat, if you put it in the chat, it'll be accessible for everybody once they click it. So, they could click it and they can see the order.", "2727": "Oh, here we go. Sorry.", "2728": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's right on the bottom. Thank you. All right. Yeah. And I'll start off.", "2729": "So, my hopes and dreams, following the COVID-19 era... okay, sorry. My screen froze a little bit. My hopes and dreams center mainly around the unemployment. I'm hoping that the situation where people are on the fence about returning to work because they're receiving money, I hope that changes, because that can actually bring a lot of confusion and backlash later on. Because from what I understand, and Liam I'm sure you know as well, as job developers, we come into contact with some people who don't want, or aren't as eager to return to work because all of the sudden, they're receiving sometimes $800 a week. And that could be a dangerous situation. Because what happens is we're depending on something that isn't definite, which definitely a job will provide. So, that's my hope, is that following all this initial confusion, people have that sense to go right back into the workforce. All right?", "2730": "All right, so, next is Mike Burg.", "2731": "Yes.", "2732": "What are your hopes and dreams, moving forward, after this quarantine? What are you hoping, for the job market?", "2733": "I'm hoping we can to work where I work at QEC.", "2734": "Okay. All right.", "2735": "I like my job there and I like the people I work with there.", "2736": "Okay, that makes sense. Is that it?", "2737": "Well, during the pandemic, time that I've been doing some cleaning. Sweeping, mopping, cleaning up. Doing laundry, doing gardening outside.", "2738": "Okay. Thank you.", "2739": "Did some shredding.", "2740": "Shredding?", "2741": "That's good.", "2742": "All right, Michelle.", "2743": "Yes.", "2744": "What are your hopes and dreams moving forward, after this? Are you hoping for any change?", "2745": "All I care about is going back to work and doing what I'm supposed to be doing and greeting the guests as they come in and out of the restaurant and basically I'm just struggling right now. Because me not having any money coming into me right now, it's just been very stressful [inaudible 00:47:27].", "2746": "But after pursuing other things, until I go back to work. I've been pursuing my artwork and communicating with my friends, doing things for my family, like my mom, helping my mom. And it's just been very stressful for me because I really need to go back to work. And as Liam knows, I work for... You know, Richard, I work for Shake Shack. And all I want to do is just go back to work.", "2747": "Okay. Thank you. Shikar. Hey Shikar, are you there? Oh, you're muted.", "2748": "Sorry.", "2749": "Yeah, no problem.", "2750": "No, I just want for people to get back on their feet and just [inaudible] people do what they got to do. And just hope people get financial money till they have something to fall back on, for bills and stuff like that. Because during these days, you can't rely on darn trust money and stuff like that. And then an epidemic and it's like, hopefully you can see on stuff like any sports stuff that you want to see. Like baseball or anything that comes in. Because a lot of the sports is coming back and it's like some stuff, they're not showing up for it, because they just protecting their wellbeing and so they can be healthy and stuff like that.", "2751": "That's good. That's good. Thank you. All right, Ashton.", "2752": "For me, I want to go back to work, but I also want safety. People to wear masks and gloves.", "2753": "Is that it?", "2754": "Yeah.", "2755": "Okay. That's fine. Thank you.", "2756": "Josue.", "2757": "Yeah. [inaudible] I want to go back to work soon. Hopefully, all the germs on the streets can clear the hell out. Clear the hell out. [crosstalk]", "2758": "Awesome.", "2759": "Understood. Thank you. Yeah. No, I hear you. All right, Daniel.", "2760": "Yes, Mr. Richard?", "2761": "What are your hopes and dreams moving forward, after this pandemic?", "2762": "Finding a job, making money.", "2763": "Making money?", "2764": "Yeah.", "2765": "Simple and quick. All right, I like it. Okay. And then Liam.", "2766": "Yeah, sorry.", "2767": "No, no, that's fine, that's fine. What are your hopes and dreams?", "2768": "[crosstalk] Well, there's a lot of different ways to look at it. From a perspective of enjoying my life, I want the NBA and the baseball and the football and things like that to start happening again and movies to open and theme parks, Six Flags Great Adventures. I think that's a little bit selfish of me when people are still getting sick by this and there's a lot of different stuff going on in the world.", "2769": "And then from a financial aspect, I want to have job security, and I have a newborn baby, so I'm a little worried about those things too. And I'm also worried about the health of my family. Particularly, my mom and dad and my elderly family members. So, there's a lot of different things that I'm worried about. And I'm trying to just take it one day at a time and stay positive.", "2770": "But I do hope that New York, and the rest of the United States, clear up a lot of what going on and hopefully the spread of this stuff goes down. And I do hope people vote and make the right decision more [inaudible] in November. And I think that'll help us in a lot of other ways, too. And I'll leave it at that, I guess.", "2771": "Great answer.", "2772": "Oh, one more. They said football should be played on schedule.", "2773": "I agree with that Richard, what Liam just said.", "2774": "Yeah. I agree. Thank you, everybody. Okay, so we're actually getting ready to wrap things up. All right? We have one more section.", "2775": "So, here's a question for more reflection. Given our conversation today, what would a health New York City, where everyone can be healthy, look like? What would it feel like? So, I'll start things off.", "2776": "I believe a healthy New York is just people being more informed about what they're putting in their bodies. You don't have to be a dedicated vegan like myself or Daniel, you can just be somebody who's just more aware, who reads the labels, who's just more aware of the chemicals. Because sometimes it can be shocking the things that we can consume. So, I think a healthier New York, a healthier world would be one where we put more of an emphasis on paying attention to some of the things that we put in our bodies.", "2777": "And Mike Burg, you're up next. What does a health New York look like for you?", "2778": "A healthy New York [inaudible] have to come up with some kind of antidote, a cure for COVID-19, or similar, like a flu shot.", "2779": "Okay. All right. Thank you. Michelle, you're up next.", "2780": "Yes.", "2781": "What does a health New York look like for you?", "2782": "Well, a healthier New York looks like, I want to find a cure for the COVID-19 and I just want things to open up again, I want things to be back to normal. I want movie theaters, like Liam said, I want movie theaters to open up again. I want restaurants to start opening up again. That's all I really want. And I just want people to be safe during the pandemic.", "2783": "Thank you, thank you. All right, Shikar.", "2784": "Well, what I want is, I want a healthy environment and people to take care of mother earth and people go out often, so it won't be no protesting and no racism and don't discriminate nobody's background or race colors.", "2785": "That's a very healthy New York, that's a very healthy world. I agree.", "2786": "Just like this, Richard.", "2787": "Yeah. That's... yeah, absolutely. All right. So, Ashton.", "2788": "For me, I would [crosstalk] eat more fruits, vegetables, drink plenty of water, get plenty of sunlight and I just want the city to go back to normal. Like, everything open up, see more people. I want activities, interactions.", "2789": "Okay. All right. Thank you. That's a good answer.", "2790": "Josue.", "2791": "Yeah. [crosstalk]", "2792": "What does a healthy New York look like for you?", "2793": "[inaudible] all the germs clear out and [inaudible] sports wise, more friends to be [inaudible 00:56:00]. More friends coming, or they back you up. [inaudible] they cheer for you, whether you're winning or losing.", "2794": "Okay. All right, thank you. Thank you, Josue.", "2795": "And Daniel.", "2796": "Yes, Richard.", "2797": "Yes. What does a health New York look like to you?", "2798": "Going way back it was. No violence, no crime.", "2799": "Oh, okay. So, you said, going back the way it was.", "2800": "Yes. It's not fair. I can't go to my favorite store and shop.", "2801": "Oh, okay. So you don't think there are any changes at all necessary?", "2802": "No, it's because I don't like it when people start protesting and they have to blame it on the companies, [crosstalk 00:56:57].", "2803": "Okay. That's an interesting perspective.", "2804": "They ain't no justice, no peace.", "2805": "I agree with that, Richard.", "2806": "It's dependent upon-", "2807": "All right. Yeah. Well, thank you, thank you.", "2808": "It keeps you awake at night.", "2809": "Sorry, there's a helicopter flying by.", "2810": "It keeps you-", "2811": "But thank you.", "2812": "[crosstalk] flying by, Richard?", "2813": "No, it was a helicopter. I didn't want there to be any background interference. But thank you.", "2814": "And Liam.", "2815": "Liam, let's go, rock and roll, dude.", "2816": "A healthier New York, free hotdogs for everyone. No, I'm just kidding.", "2817": "Yeah, what about going back to program, Liam?", "2818": "I had to say one joke during this whole segment. No, hotdogs are really bad for you. Don't eat any hotdogs. I think, [crosstalk 00:57:50], a healthy New York is kind of like what New York used to be before COVID-19, but a little bit more cognizant of what kind of foods we put in our bodies and also just a sense of harmony and a sense of community and people getting along and [inaudible] together and [inaudible] and stuff like that. And [inaudible] a way for people to open up their yes and see what's going on in the world, everywhere, in every state, in United States, these things go on. The injustices and stuff happen and a way to put it under a microscope, while everyone was at home reflecting on things that are going on in the world.", "2819": "But I think a New York that could be healthy and great, in my eyes, is one that opens up its public [inaudible] and lets people go out and live their lives. And if they aren't feeling healthy, have the wisdom and intelligence to say, \"You know what? Maybe I'll stay home today, just in case I do have something that's contagious and I'll stay in.\" And hopefully things get back to normal and the whole unemployment thing changes as well. [inaudible] people go back to work and you can only sit at home for so long collecting a paycheck before you get sick of it. I know a lot of people that have been sitting at home collecting unemployment and they would much rather go back to work, even if they take a little bit of a pay cut, just to get back in a social setting.", "2820": "But I thought this was a really awesome conversation and I want to thank everyone for spending their time with us.", "2821": "Absolutely. So, we have just one last section. Just [crosstalk 00:59:40]. So, now we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. Please respond to whichever of these prompts resonates with you.", "2822": "What is one thing you would want your local representative to hear, from you? So, this is an opportunity for everyone to hear your voice.", "2823": "The other question that you can answer is, if you can ask a question to another group that is gathering in NYC for these same type of conversations, what would it be?", "2824": "All right, so your picks can either be, one thing that you want your local representative to hear from you or if you can ask a question to another group that's gathering [crosstalk 01:00:19].", "2825": "All right? So, I'll start off with one thing that we'd like for our representative to hear. I would say to listen to the voices of the people who sometimes don't have one for themselves. That's something that all of us could [inaudible 01:00:40]. So, I know that there are a lot of hard workers in this group, in this Zoom conversation today, as well as hard workers for the other people who could have joined us for that conversation within our program.", "2826": "And one thing I'd like for our local representative is to give more opportunity to people who may have disabilities, who may be low on income, who may be struggling for anything else because they're just as hard a workers, if not harder, than anybody else. So, that's one thing I'd like for our local representatives to hear.", "2827": "And we'll shift it over to Mike Burg. So, Mike, do you want me to repeat the question? Or do you know. It's either one thing you want your local representative to hear or if you could ask a group a question.", "2828": "Well, what was the question?", "2829": "Is there anything that you would like your local representative to hear or is there a question that you would ask another group, what would it be?", "2830": "I would say, I want to hear that they should have-", "2831": "Mike, think about this. Is there a question that you would ask another group, in the future, that would have these same conversations? Is there a question [crosstalk]", "2832": "Yeah. I would say, what was the cause of the pandemic?", "2833": "Okay. What was the cause. That's a good question. Thank you.", "2834": "Michelle.", "2835": "Yes.", "2836": "All right, so what's something that you'd want your local representatives to hear or what is a question that you would ask another group [crosstalk]", "2837": "What I want my local representative to hear is I want things to be back to normal. I want places to open up again. I want to be able to go back to work and socialize with the people out there. And I just want things to go back to the way they used to be, where you're able to go out to parks and do a lot of different thing, activities. And I just want my neighborhood to be safe.", "2838": "Okay. Shikar.", "2839": "Okay. One thing's... let's see. I could ask is, what's the one thing that you could change about yourself for any job opportunities and what can you also do to better more yourself for your skills, out in the field or independently on your own.", "2840": "Those are two very good questions, Shikar. Thank you, Shikar.", "2841": "You're welcome.", "2842": "Ashton.", "2843": "What I want is more resources, like food stamp and to help with disability and more money.", "2844": "I agree with that, Richard.", "2845": "Me too! I agree with that. I need money.", "2846": "I just need to go back to work so I can start making money again.", "2847": "Me too.", "2848": "Agree, agreed. Thank you, Ashton, thank you.", "2849": "Josue, what's one thing that you would like your local representative to hear? Oh, you're on the phone.", "2850": "Yeah, yeah. [inaudible]", "2851": "Yeah, no worries, no worries.", "2852": "We'll circle back to Josue.", "2853": "Daniel.", "2854": "Daniel.", "2855": "Yes! Send me anything. I'm an open book.", "2856": "Yes, Mr. Richard?", "2857": "Oh, what is...", "2858": "Richard?", "2859": "I'm sorry, Josue? Josue, go ahead.", "2860": "Yeah, answer question, yeah. [inaudible 01:05:16]. I'll answer.", "2861": "Okay. I'll come back to you Daniel. Thank you. Josue.", "2862": "Tell me, what's one thing you'd want your local representative [inaudible 01:05:29].", "2863": "[inaudible] representative of? How do we get all these germs off the streets? And how do we keep the people safe? And the one thing, how do we disinfect [inaudible 01:05:44], citywide? [inaudible] we get to [inaudible] communication, socialization, [inaudible] like the holidays, we have few months worth of holidays, like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas. You know?", "2864": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay.", "2865": "[inaudible] have a normal safe holidays, like Labor Day, Halloween, [inaudible 01:06:17], Thanksgiving, Christmas. People who come together.", "2866": "I agree with that, Richard. I just want things to be back. I just want things to open up again. So that I could be able to get a nice haircut.", "2867": "That's fair. That's fair. Thank you.", "2868": "All right, Daniel, thank you for waiting.", "2869": "What, Richard?", "2870": "Daniel, what's one thing you'd want your local representative to hear?", "2871": "I want it to go everything back to normal and used to peaceful, not war, Richard. Hello?", "2872": "Yeah.", "2873": "I don't want war, Richard, between the people and the police, I want it to go back to normal, the way it was.", "2874": "Okay, okay. That's fair.", "2875": "It ain't going to happen, Richard. I wish it would go back to the way it was without these riots.", "2876": "Hey, that's not a good attitude to have. It got us [crosstalk 01:07:27], right?", "2877": "I just want everything to be back to normal. I just want them to get justice so these riots would stop.", "2878": "No, but it's going haywire, right about now, Richard. Buildings being destroyed. What's that called? I think-", "2879": "Vandalism. Vandalism.", "2880": "Companies and everything.", "2881": "Can you guys let Michael Burg talk, real quick?", "2882": "Yes.", "2883": "Okay.", "2884": "Michael?", "2885": "Yeah.", "2886": "Was there... Right, right. Go ahead.", "2887": "Yeah. I would say they should have [crosstalk 01:08:19].", "2888": "Okay. Thank you. All right. And Liam, did you want to [inaudible 01:08:31].", "2889": "If I had an opportunity to talk to a councilman or a question I'd like to ask, I guess, I would just hope that there is some sort of structure and way we can get back to normal and if [inaudible] four-day workweek or certain jobs covering it from Tuesday to Friday, certain jobs working from Monday to Thursday. People [inaudible] the hours of their day a little bit differently, I think all those things are fine, if we can enjoy what New York City used to be like. Maybe like, when are we going to open up the parks and put the basketball rims back up and [crosstalk]", "2890": "It was feasible before that whole haywire happened.", "2891": "And that's a whole separate thing. I definitely want neighborhoods to be safe and people to protest peacefully. There's a peaceful way to protest and there's not.", "2892": "Vandalism.", "2893": "Hopefully, one more thing would be, I think there needs to be more activities that don't cost money for people that live in the city to do. Whether it be sports activities or different types of things that maybe the police or maybe the city can do or different types of ways to have fun, especially during the summer.", "2894": "I agree with Liam, Richard. I just want this to stop that-", "2895": "We're prepared-", "2896": "Hold on, Danny.", "2897": "I just want everything to get back to normal because all I want is for my job to be open again so that people can come back inside. I'll be able to do my job and help people.", "2898": "And I want people to walk without getting... what's that called? Beat up. I want it to be safe for the people so they can go to work peacefully.", "2899": "It's not going to happen.", "2900": "It's a pain in the butt, no offense.", "2901": "Are we done, Richard?", "2902": "Well, we're getting ready to wrap up. So wait, that's everything, right?", "2903": "Yes.", "2904": "Yes.", "2905": "Okay. So, well, those are all the questions that we have for you. Do you have any closing thoughts that you would like to share or other general reflections on the conversation?", "2906": "Nope.", "2907": "I do.", "2908": "Not me. I'm good.", "2909": "I do.", "2910": "Go ahead, Michelle.", "2911": "All I care about right now is that I'm glad I have the services from you guys. I'm glad that you guys there to support me and help me while I'm going through this pandemic and once I go back to work, I'm glad you guys are there for me.", "2912": "Thank you, Michelle. Look, it's our pleasure.", "2913": "Mostly Liam, too. Because I see Liam, every time I'm at work, I always see Liam and his family.", "2914": "I always see Liam [inaudible] when I was working. He always gave me support when I needed it.", "2915": "But Danny, you don't understand. His family lives near where I work at.", "2916": "Really?", "2917": "Yes. Right, Liam?", "2918": "Richard, when are you going to come to my job when I come back? When are you going to come to Shake Shack when I go back?", "2919": "As soon as I can. I love Shake Shack, all right?", "2920": "When are you going to come to the one in Manhattan?", "2921": "I will make that trip. I don't even work in Manhattan. I'll make that trip.", "2922": "Well, you know, you should come with Liam one day.", "2923": "I will. I will.", "2924": "Richard, are we done?", "2925": "Yeah. All right. So, I'm going wrap everything up. So, just a reminder, what will happen with the thoughts you just shared. These recordings will be transcribed, indexed and eventually shared with journalists, public officials and [inaudible] Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Health Department. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voices Network. We want to convene another group of friends to participate or know others who want to participate-", "2926": "It is kind of-", "2927": "Hold on, Danny! Let him finish. Sorry, Richard. Can you finish?", "2928": "No worries.", "2929": "Please go to lvn.org. Thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts. And-", "2930": "Okay. That will be recorded and I'm going to tell you what's happening in that in a few seconds. I have begun recording at this time. I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded. So, that means if you're not looking as flawless like this, you don't have to worry about it because it's going to be trashed, but the audio is going to remain, right?", "2931": "And the audio will become part of the LVN collection level of voices that we're collecting and I'll tell you a little bit more about what's that purpose. And there are three purposes for this conversation. One, first, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's life \u2026 lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationship with one another.", "2932": "Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the local community to candidates, policy, makers, and members of the media. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than being the conversation with our positions on issues.", "2933": "In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information. That's an important part. So, PHI is protected and we're just talking about more broad than it is centralized. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations.", "2934": "Eventually, we'll be making the recording available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in this project at Cortico's instruction, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voice Network to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "2935": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in the local newspaper or website, or be broadcast on local radio stations, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So, please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree, you can say, \u201cYes, I agree,\u201d or shake your head.", "2936": "[inaudible] right now. Okay, great. Thank you so much. That was a hard part, me just saying all of that. It gets fun. We want to make sure that \u2026 Here's some house rules, so everyone's on the same page. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both, to share and learn from others in this conversation. And to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're also on the materials we send just with you and your confirmation email.", "2937": "Number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experience. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time, allow others to finish speaking and take turns. Four, stay curious, ask honest questions. Number five, pause, take time for reflection. Number six, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact.", "2938": "Number seven, when possible close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. So, that's basic guidelines. Are there any other rules or anything that you could maybe probably like to add or change to this? No? Super. So, we're going to jump straight into it now.", "2939": "For the ease of the virtual conversation, you're going to use a modified circle which is a process which each person will take a turn. I posted the list here, which is going to be the order which we'll go and I'll help to transition this for us, like from one person to the next. However, you can always pass on a question or pass and ask us to come back while you get a chance to think about the question that's being asked. Does anyone has a question about that process?", "2940": "Right. Okay. Just to begin, we want to do a quick round just of introductions. Please share just your first name or a pseudonym. In addition, we'll ask a little bit background about yourself, like who you are, where do you live? What do you do? And then finally a value that is important to you and how it's related to what's being brought today.", "2941": "For this round, I'll go first.", "2942": "Mike, can you repeat the questions [crosstalk 00:05:51]?", "2943": "Sure. The value \u2026 It's about a little general information about yourself, like your name, where you're from, where you live, what do you do? And then a value that is important to you and how it is related to what brought you here today. All right? I'll go.", "2944": "Hey guys, my name is Mike. My preferred gender pronouns are he, him, his. I'm 39 years old. I am currently living in Pelham Bay for about a year. Prior to that, I lived in different parts of Queens and in the city as well. I'm heavily involved with social services. One of the most important ones to me is the organizations I started out my closet, which [inaudible] you know, I advocate Cortico for this, it helps homeless obviously youth.", "2945": "A little bit about me, my family's from Guyana, South America. I'm a mixed race. I'm half Indo-Caribbean and my mom's [inaudible 00:06:56]. I identify also as a gay male. A value that is important to me is that authenticity, I feel when sharing experiences and being authentic, you're able to have the best version of yourself, so others could truly value and seek who you are for you. That's me.", "2946": "The first person that is going to go is going to be Chris Maura. Hi Chris?", "2947": "Hi. You can hear me?", "2948": "Yes.", "2949": "All good. My name is Christopher Maura. I am located in downtown Brooklyn. I am 33. What was one of the other questions?", "2950": "A little bit about yourself? [inaudible] and what do you do and a value that's important to you.", "2951": "I, previously, before all this pandemic stuff, I used to work in social work as well. I worked with people dealing with medical, mental health issues. And then I was also taking classes going towards nursing. I already have a degree in accounting. I know it sounds like a switch up. And so, a value that is important to me, I think there's a lot, there's many. I would say maybe integrity is very important to me.", "2952": "I try to do the right thing despite people being around me. For me, it's a thing where you see a lot of people doing certain things just for the moment. And for me, I think it's important to just acting in good faith when you're doing things, overall. But yeah.", "2953": "Super. Thank you, Christopher. Next, we have Andy from Queens. Hi Andy?", "2954": "Hi. My name's Andy. I'm 23. My background is Dominican and for \u2026 Sorry, I'm getting used to talking to people again. But for work, I work in fashion. I work as a freelance stylist and I think something that's important to me is to try and be confident and always carry that with you. I think when you bring confidence to anything that you do, it just makes it better and makes it more personal and makes it about you as well. And I'm happy to be here talking with everyone.", "2955": "Thanks, Andy. Welcome. Next, we have Yara.", "2956": "Yara.", "2957": "Yara.", "2958": "Hi everyone? I'm Yara from the Bronx. I've been in the Bronx for the last, what now? 15 years. Before that, I was in Sunset Park. I went to high school in Brooklyn, then I don't know why I decided to come to the Bronx. I've been working with the criminal justice population since 2008. And I can say when it comes to me, values is a lot, but the one that I love the most is giving back and supporting, especially when it comes to my community.", "2959": "So, I am glad to be part of this conversation, hoping that at the end, we can build a great relationship, great communication that can be passed on to our communities and learn from each other, because honestly, I don't know anything when it comes to \u2026 Nothing is going on right now in Queens and Brooklyn, so I'm just here in my little bubble when it comes to the Bronx, so it would be great to learn from all the communities", "2960": "Yara for president, 2020. Next, we have Caesar. Hi Caesar? Unmute. Yes.", "2961": "Hey guys? Hey guys? My name is Caesar. I am 32 years old. My family background is Puerto Rican and Dominican. I was born and raised in New York city, specifically Manhattan and the Bronx. I've been in upper West side my whole life, but I've moved a few times back and forth between Washington Heights and the Bronx. I lived in the Bronx at one point for about seven or eight years, around West Farms square, kind of close to the Bronx zoo.", "2962": "I actually do have a background in social services for a little while. I actually was working here with Mikey at our previous organization. Currently, I am a flight attendant right now in this crazy time for the travel and airline industry, but yeah. What else was I supposed to say? I'm sorry. Am I missing something?", "2963": "The pin number to your bank account. No, an important value that you think it's good to have in this conversation.", "2964": "Okay. I actually loved and really related to what Yara said, because giving back and just always being there for your community and like what's going on, kind of standing up for minorities and whatnot, we have to stick together. Honestly, I'm whack, it's just a story for another time, but I'm the type of person who loves to give back and always be a part of a community, since I was in early like middle school, I've always done volunteer work, whether it's for local shelters, churches.", "2965": "And I just feel like as people, as human beings, we have to make sure that we always constantly do that, because there's so many people out there that not only just the media, like the media reports so much, but there's so many people out there that need help and need assistance. And I feel like I'm always \u2026 one of my most important attributes for myself is, I always love to help people with contributing and however I can, you know what I'm saying?", "2966": "So, I think that's something that's really important to me is giving back and being there for the community and people [crosstalk 00:13:44].", "2967": "Right. Thank you, Caesar. Finally, we have Michael Monroe. Hi Mike?", "2968": "Hey guys? My name is Michael Monroe. I'm originally from Florida. Right now, I live in Brooklyn, New York, I'm in Park Slope. What I do for a living is public relations and marketing. Basically, just sprucing up stuff digitally, if that makes any sense. A value that I would have to be-", "2969": "How old are you, Michael?", "2970": "Oh, I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old.", "2971": "How old?", "2972": "28.", "2973": "28?", "2974": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "2975": "Okay.", "2976": "Can you hear me? Is it coming through clear?", "2977": "Yeah.", "2978": "And a value that I have, but I guess I would have to say \u2026 I guess I can piggyback off of what Chris said, integrity. I love making sure that everyone's treated fairly and I guess you could say playing nice. So, that's what I like.", "2979": "Thank you all for those introductions [inaudible] values that I feel that you will add to this conversation. All right. Jumping in, now we're going to get into a little more deeper. Oh, okay. Next, we'd like to invite you to share a little bit about yourself since you'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing looked like and feel like to you.", "2980": "Next, think of a time, place or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time and how did you feel? I'm going to run that by you one more time.", "2981": "Think of a time, or place, or a story when you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time and how did you feel?", "2982": "We will go around one at a time to share your stories. Please remember that this is being recorded, so we ask that you not disclose any sensitive, personal health information or use the names of other people when telling your stories. I'm going to start. I felt my healthiest in my life when, I would say maybe up to three years ago.", "2983": "I never had any other major health issues, but I'm approaching my 40s, so my neck, my back, my knees, things are hurting. They're aching [inaudible 00:16:34]. I've always been active in the gym and playing sports, always playing volleyball and just always doing wear and tear on my body. And I felt that with having that healthy lifestyle, that it will be perfect to contain and maintain health.", "2984": "But one day I just ran up the stairs and then my back went out and it was horrible. It totally impacted my mood, my wellbeing, because it made me and forced me to stop playing volleyball to the degree that I used to play every Friday for hours. It also had me using pain meds and it would make me sleepy. I'm a very active and alive person, so that really impacted my mental health also, not being able to just be myself because I had painkillers in my body.", "2985": "And I felt \u2026 When I was healthiest, I felt so alive because I felt like I was able to go get and go do anytime I want. And that has sort of changed, because in the mornings when I wake up now, my back will always be tight in my hamstrings, right? So, I have to really stretch and do that extra effort to incorporate new routines and see my normal goal get live. And if I don't, I normally will feel the consequences.", "2986": "And I feel like when you're your healthiest, or you're most functioning at your best, you have this bigger insight, this, I could do everything and anything, and nothing's going to stop you. So, I can imagine how health really impacts your mental being and even sometimes the goals and things you'd personally want for yourself. So, that's my little take on that.", "2987": "Alright Chris, you're up.", "2988": "Okay. Oh wait, are we going in this lineup for every conversation?", "2989": "Yes, unless you say skip and I have to come back.", "2990": "Okay, because I was thinking. When I felt my healthiest, I would say I feel my healthiest now. I would say, okay. So, I guess working with the individuals that I worked with when I was working in social work, the people that was dealing with medical and mental health, it made me acknowledge my mental state and not just only my medical health.", "2991": "So, growing up, you don't really \u2026 I wasn't aware of the wear and tear on your body. I would be very active and not think about, \u201cOh, it's going to affect me. It'll be years from now.\u201d And then one day, my side started hurting me and then I ended up getting kidney stones and then years from then, I started having some stomach issues and then I decided to get a colonoscopy.", "2992": "But the only way I started doing that is when things started to arise. I wasn't aware of those things prior. And then speaking with the medical provider during this the process, I was being well-informed of like, age really has no \u2026 I guess there's no set age where you can get something, where you can develop something.", "2993": "It's important to check in with your doctor now and again, yearly to make sure that your health is where it needs to be. And again, both medical and mental health. And again, I think what led me to it was more so just dealing with this community and realizing like, it didn't matter what age they were. They were all going through different things at different times in their life and that just made me want to seek out some just confirmation that I was healthy. Was there anything else? Was there any more questions?", "2994": "Thank you Chris for sharing that.", "2995": "Okay.", "2996": "Next it will be Andy.", "2997": "I have to agree with Chris also. Right now, I feel my healthiest and it's primarily because I have the time to think about myself and then treat myself to the things that my body's saying that it wants, or I'm doing things that are also just keeping me mentally satisfied. I work in fashion and for me it's always been very long hours and back to back days, on and on end and days without sleeping.", "2998": "So, I can be very unhealthy when I'm working. Due to COVID, I haven't been working really. It's been so nice to be able to wake up when I want to wake up and sleep whenever I want to sleep. So, I think, yeah, right now I'm my most healthiest.", "2999": "But when I've been my \u2026 And then those moments when I can take care of myself because of work, it's literally I'm like, I'm traveling and I have to miss my doctor's appointments. And then like my doctor's office says like, \u201cOh, we can reschedule you for a month and a half.\u201d So, it's kind of like, it sucks and then it's like, \u201cOkay.\u201d", "3000": "Then I take my next appointment, but then work comes around and I have my priorities because there's a place that I see myself in the future. And so, it's like, when I was working, I was just at a place where I needed to prioritize my work. So, I'm happy to have had some time right now. I haven't seen my doctor or spoken to them throughout COVID, but I feel very healthy.", "3001": "I haven't been so active in terms of working out, because of not being able to go to the gym, but I recently moved into my mother's house and my bike is here. So, I started \u2026 have a trainer stand, so I can ride my bike inside because I'm a little lazy to go on an adventure on my bike. I just ride it in place in my driveway. But yeah, is that good or do I have to \u2026?", "3002": "It's good. It's good. Your bike have a basket?", "3003": "What?", "3004": "Your bike have a basket?", "3005": "What do you mean? Oh, no, it doesn't. It's like a riding bike, so it's like, I bought a bike thinking I could just put a basket on any bike that I wanted, but I didn't do the research and I bought this bike and put a basket on it. And I wanted one, but I don't have it.", "3006": "Try Amazon. I'm sure there's like a velcro attachment.", "3007": "Yeah. When actually I get my health insurance, I'll [inaudible] once I fall off.", "3008": "I know. Next, we have Yara.", "3009": "That question got me thinking and thinking hard, because I didn't say my age before, so I am 40. I remember that between like 14 \u2026 I came to the US at the age of 14 from the Dominican Republic. So, from 14 to 17 I had my first son at 17, so I was on the go. I was clubbing every day, I was taking my uniform to the club, going from the club to my dad's, work on the store and I was like on the go.", "3010": "I know that at that time I was feeling my best. I was healthiest when going to school, two jobs, like I was on the go. Then everything changed, like in between maybe like 22 to 25. And then after that, for the last 13 years, it's like every year I get a new diagnosis and something when it comes to my health.", "3011": "So, it gets to a point that I don't like to go to the doctors, because it's just like, anytime I go, I can go for a headache and the next thing is like, \u201cOh, you need a brain surgery.\u201d", "3012": "Wow.", "3013": "Or I go because a finger hurts and it's like, \u201cOh, you need a \u2026 We need to do what? A surgery on your head. So, that's how I feel right now. So, I try to smile every day. I try to be the most happy and bubbly and talkative, and sometime I can come up to people that like, I don't care, I don't have any feelings, but a reality is like, I'm in pain every day. So, when it comes to my health, I could \u2026 My happiest moment once again, it's like up to 22.", "3014": "And then after that, it just like, I just try to fake it to make it like, okay, I'm happy. I'm good. But in reality, it's like my health, it's not. And it's when it comes to me, it's just like, I'm just not going to go to the doctor because it's just like, I'm scared that they're going to say like, \u201cOh, you need dental surgery, or now you have a new diagnosis.\u201d", "3015": "Wow. Oh, man. I could definitely feel that. I could definitely feel that. You've shared that. Ooh, all right. Caesar.", "3016": "Yeah, that was a lot to take in. I'm sorry [inaudible] every treatment that you're going through, there's a lot. That really does. And my mom goes through stuff, the same thing. She really hates doctors because of that. I really have to say, there's different things that I can talk about as far as being healthy, because I can talk about like the medical, like body-wise and then I could talk about like mental health.", "3017": "So, there's like two different aspects for me, because for mental health, I can say that it's been a roller coaster for me, especially when \u2026 I think Chris touched on this a little bit, like working with the \u2026 In social services, working to clients with mental health issues. When I was doing that at the time, it actually did kind of take a toll on me for a little while just because I've never dealt with so much people that had severe mental health issues.", "3018": "And then back in the day, when you're young growing up, you don't really think about what is mental health awareness? What is mental health issues? You don't really think about that. The only thing when you really think about mental health is like people were in a psych ward or whatnot, like there's people who have mental health issues that are regular people walking down the street; whether it's anxiety, depression and things like that.", "3019": "And I really got to see that when I was working with the mental health population and social services and it was just an eye opener. And I started to feel like, wow, any age, there's kids, there's teens, there's young adults and older adults, they kind of all deal with the same issues, but at different spectrums and aspects and it's just crazy to see that. I started seeing that in myself, in certain things where like, oh, well, certain things like for example, this pandemic, being closed in inside and being confined is actually dealing with a lot of people's mental health and not being able to socialize or go outside and be active.", "3020": "Sorry. I'm like, I don't even have water near me to get something to drink. But for that aspect, I feel like this pandemic has really taken a little toll on me. And back when I was doing social work, it took a little toll on me and it just opened my eyes and opened my mind to mental health awareness and mental health issues in a different level. As far as medical, when I was younger, I used to go to the doctors a lot because I had a heart condition and I did have to have a surgery. It wasn't open heart surgery, but it was through my main artery, veins or whatever, it was like whatever.", "3021": "I don't know how to explain the procedure, but when I had that, it actually helped me kind of be more active because before I couldn't be as active. My heart rate couldn't go too high, because it would cause me a lot of heart pains and conditions. But since I had the procedure, I've been able to be a lot more active, but I will have to say like nowadays, I've see it coming back a little bit.", "3022": "And I actually recently just had a doctor's appointment with my cardiologist three days ago and I went to Mount Sinai downtown at 10 Union Square, and I have to do a heart test where they have to fit all the little stickies all over your heart and they have to do the EKGs, which they call the ECGs now. And I have to do a running test on a treadmill, so they can monitor my heart.", "3023": "And surprisingly, they were able to stress it enough where they see that it's not as bad as I thought. That actually makes me feel good knowing that, \u201cOkay, I don't have to be scared to be more active and whatnot, because I really thought it was an issue where like, anything can happen to me. I might pass out on the street or something like that.\u201d", "3024": "But I felt the most healthiest when I guess, like, I would say maybe early college days, I guess right after high school. I was really active and now I feel like little things are coming up now that I'm concerned about and like, \u201cOh my God, should I go to the doctor?\u201d Now I make it a point to go to the cardiologist, like once a year, dentist regularly and kind of like check-up more myself because I noticed a lot of people in my family, things are just coming up out of nowhere and it's like, I don't want to be aware before they hear or before they come.", "3025": "So, I think I'm just being more on top of that for myself.", "3026": "And it's so interesting that most of us, or I would say, all of us are young people and they don't tell you those things. They say, eat this, do this and you'll be super healthy and then we experienced life in all of these [inaudible] this disposition to just pop up and you're like, \u201cWhere did that come from?\u201d And then part of it [crosstalk 00:31:18].", "3027": "I thought an apple a day would keep the doctor away. What happened?", "3028": "Yeah. Welcome back Michael Monroe. [inaudible] still engaging in that conversation. When did you feel the most healthiest and just the little stories around that and why?", "3029": "Okay. Sorry, by the way, my phone died, it was plugged in. I was like, \u201cWait, what happened? What happened?\u201d But I guess it wasn't plugged in properly. So, I'm back. I had to have a little dramatic reentrance there. I don't know about \u2026 I guess to be honest, I guess you could say I felt my healthiest right after high school ever since I've been out on my own, I guess you can say that sense of independence has also taken a toll on self-discipline if that makes any sense.", "3030": "So, my eating habits and such have not been the best. I really felt completely healthy since right after high school and also, to go off of what Caesar said, mental health is also a form of health and that's also what plays a role in dieting. Where you are mentally decides or dictates whether or not you could, I guess \u2026 I can't find the words for it. This all falls down to self-discipline and whether or not you have the energy for that.", "3031": "So, I guess with me being 28 years old now, I don't want to be older regretting decisions that could have easily been made now. So, maybe I should start tackling that now the dieting thing, but that's really what I would say what would be the biggest part of the health is the dieting. But I guess you could say like, I felt my healthiest right after high school. I was probably like 18 to 20. I felt pretty good around that time.", "3032": "And it's so important because people [inaudible] have to be [inaudible] but when I'm stressed or going through it, I don't eat. I can't. it's like, my body gets unstable. It gets totally [inaudible 00:33:49].", "3033": "Oh, I'm Jealous. I'm jealous. I do the opposite. No.", "3034": "I think it's very important that you just touched base on your food, dieting, because I think people forget that nutrition has a lot to do with your mental health and medical health. It impacts you a lot. And growing up again, eat your carrots and eat your fruit and your vegetables. But they don't tell you what it does to your body and the pros and cons of eating certain types of foods and worry about time of the day.", "3035": "And the more and more you eat certain things that are bad for you, the more and more you want it, the more and more you're complacent with, the more and more it becomes regular in just your daily life. It just becomes what you do and you don't realize that it's taking a toll on you until it's already done.", "3036": "I know for me, it's like, I sort of sometimes want to reward myself with bad food. I don't know, like say I work out all the hard session and then I'm just like, \u201cOh, okay. Let me have this one, two, three ice cream.\u201d Do you guys do that? Do you try that constantly and say like, \u201cOh, I don't care.\u201d [inaudible 00:35:13].", "3037": "I was going to say, what type of person? Well, maybe there are people out there who do it, but who rewards themselves with a salad? Like, \u201cOh my God. I'm I want to reward myself with a great salad.\u201d Some people might do that [crosstalk 00:35:26], but it's like, for some reason, I feel like I'm conditioned like comfort food, comfort foods, or like ice cream. Like, \u201cOh, I want a hamburger now.\u201d", "3038": "And it's crazy because I was actually vegan for four months before the pandemic, before that. Once the pandemic hit, I was like, \u201cI can't do this anymore.\u201d And then I was just like, [inaudible 00:35:48]. And it was so bad, but I feel it was \u2026 Yeah, it was vegan. I was [crosstalk 00:35:56].", "3039": "No eggs, no nothing?", "3040": "I already have an issue with dairy, so me and dairy are like, we don't get along. But I went vegan for four months. Me and my boyfriend, we did it at the same time to support each other. And it actually, it worked pretty well. And actually, I enjoyed it, but once the pandemic hit, it was so difficult to go out and get those healthy foods again, or go out and get those things.", "3041": "And it changed. And I was like, \u201cOh, you know what? I'm stuck at home. I'd rather just eat comfort food.\u201d And I kind of want to go back to eating healthier and eating better, because I actually, I shed off a few pounds. I felt like more energy. I felt more like, \u201cYeah, I got this.\u201d And I felt good. But then when I came back to the comfortable now, you know the comfortable makes you feel like sluggish and like, \u201cOh.\u201d", "3042": "Okay, great. Thank you all. Our next conversation will be more community-focused conversations. We want to move out lots of conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly and share about either your neighborhood community, or your social community.", "3043": "When you were responding to questions, if you were speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you are thinking of when you share your story. I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope this will be a time for some back and forth among you and you share your stories.", "3044": "I invite you to respond to the points that resonate for you when they're made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. So, you guys have been good with that so far, sharing and feeding off and piggyback off, that's wonderful. So, here's the question.", "3045": "There are actually two questions, but we'll go one at a time. The first one is, what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places or things \u2026 Okay, what are some of the people, places or things have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing? All right. It's a little tight over here.", "3046": "So, what in your community is working in regards to health and wellbeing and identify those things and share a story for your experience that will help us understand this a little better. All right. So, the community I'm going to identify is medical access and healthcare or the LGBTQ community.", "3047": "When I was first coming out and learning about sexual health and my boyfriend had cheated in \u2026 And I didn't have a gay provider, I was just nervous or scared. I didn't know nothing. I thought the worst. And then the person that I researched was having an LGBTQ provider and I felt that was amazing that our community has specialized physicians that were LGBTQ people that would share and understand that there was a flag.", "3048": "So, I felt like I wasn't being judged to go to a regular provider who didn't understand. And this is way back when the LGBTQ healthcare was not as diverse and accessible than it is now. Now we know there's so many clinics and even within our insurance, they will tell you, our providers who have LGBTQ competencies.", "3049": "So, I really appreciate that, that within the LGBTQ population, that there is access to specialized care for people who identify and feel more comfortable with providers. All right. And next, I will go to Chris.", "3050": "So, this is kind of a \u2026 I'm trying to think of what I'm going to say or how I'm going to say it, actually. So I have to, I guess go back to my experience with working in my last position, working with individual mental health disorders. I want to say that a huge amount of these individuals were people that were incarcerated and some individuals dealing with some like, I guess you could say mental disorders that prevented them from I guess like some sort of delay where they weren't as aware of their, I guess, I don't know, their health as they should be.", "3051": "Some of them that were coming out of incarceration and they were to our organization and they were seeking some help mainly towards housing, I noticed lot of them wasn't aware of their health and trying to connect them to certain providers, they were unaware of their medical health or their mental health.", "3052": "They weren't diagnosed properly or they self-diagnosed themselves. So, there was a lot of issues within that community and I felt like, how do individuals come out of incarceration and there's no resources for them? How are they coming into this world that they're basically new in and don't have opportunities or options, and people are not there to guide them in the right direction?", "3053": "And I felt like that was like, not just my fault, but the community's fault as well, because it's like, how are we not informing these individuals? Like, \u201cHey, there are services out there for you.\u201d And it really got to me because there were some of these individuals that again, they didn't have the mental capacity to ask questions and when they did ask questions, they were being misinformed or people did not want to deal with them because for them it was inconvenient for them. Do you get what I'm saying?", "3054": "So, I would have to advocate for them on their behalf and it kind of got to me because it was like, why should I advocate for another human life when you have a position that should help them already? Do you get what I'm saying?", "3055": "Yes.", "3056": "So, in my head, just for me, that community I don't know. For me, that community really hit hard with me and I feel like that there has to be a little bit more, I don't know, like awareness to these individuals that are not being helped properly. I don't know if you did ask something else.", "3057": "That's great. But it's funny because \u2026 That's wonderful, because I'm going to actually just swap and switch, jump ahead because I know Yara deals with the community that you're just speaking of, that specialize in this and has been, I would say, I was hard \u2026 I wouldn't say it's specialized. So, could you talk about whatever you need to and then \u2026 or you could start with Chris, because you've worked directly with that population.", "3058": "I was just going to piggyback on what Chris said. I can actually lead on mine. My job that I have now, I'm a supervisor, case manager at the Women's Prison Association. We work mainly with women coming out of prison and coming out of Rikers Island. And yes, once you get to know their story, once you get to know them as a person, not because of booking case numbered or charges that they have in their record, you get to see that mainly they do know that there's resources.", "3059": "But if you take them back to why they get to the place where they are today, it's like their family, maybe parents, grandfather's, friends. All they know is about committing a crime or doing something for a guy, because most likely with females, we get in problems and issues and we get incarcerated because of somebody else, but us. They never saw that growing up. They never saw their mother and father going to the hospital, going to the clinic, just for an animal's check-up.", "3060": "So, in their mind, their main thing is like getting money to do what they need to do. And it's just like going back and use drugs or provide to the guy that is in jail and they got to put money in their account in order for them to eat, keeping in mind, mind you, this person is the same one that put them in that predicament or that situation, but they feel that they got to be there to provide for this person.", "3061": "So yes, we do have a whole lot of resources, but they don't want to hear that. You speak to them. You try to educate them. You try to give them, sometime take them and it's like, they don't want to hear nothing. Especially if you talk about prep, if you talk about doing an HIV, if you talk about anything related to that in their mind and just like, \u201cOh no, I got to go. I'll call you back when I need a new appointment.\u201d", "3062": "It is pretty sad and it takes a lot on us as a social services provider when we see that. And I think when it comes to \u2026 Also, when it comes to our community, that we're here to help them, it's just like, most of the time we only focus in today's day. So, we know the client came in and we know that they need housing, they need substance abuse, they need to go to medical. But I always tell them, if we don't really take them back and we start working with them from when everything started, maybe 10, five, who knows many years ago?", "3063": "If we don't start with that, we're never going to get nothing done today. Because fixing today is just like, we're just going to do our numbers that our agency needs for reporting or billing purposes. But in reality, are we doing something with the client or are we doing something for our community if we don't really look back at the problem when we start from that, to fix the problem from when it started?", "3064": "So, with Yara and Chris, the formerly incarcerated people that you've worked with, do they trust the healthcare system? Because I feel like when you think about people without access and they may look at Medicaid as a government and government has failed them in regards to incarceration and there's a whole dark shadow over that aspect. Are they more likely to stay away, because they don't want to have any affiliation with medical, because they think medical equals system?", "3065": "Do you understand the question? Or are they open to all of it? I just want to go back again. Go ahead.", "3066": "You have both. Depending \u2026 You have those that they really are ready to change and their passes are passing and they don't really think about that and they just want to move forward. But you do encounter those clients that it's just like you said, it's the system. They are minding and report it. So, I don't want to go there and share information because that can be used against me. It's like, there's a therapy that I used to do with them. It's like moral recognition therapy.", "3067": "In the book it says, \u201cHow to escape my prison.\u201d Not the prison per se, but for them it's like, \u201cOh, everybody is against me. The police just stopped me because I'm black, or the police just stopped me because I look a certain type of way. So, sometimes we are within a prison within ourselves, mine can be built. I just want to pay bills.", "3068": "So, if you don't work with them in changing that mindset, in their mind, it's like, \u201cI don't have nobody to help me because nobody has been there for me to help me before. So, I don't trust no medical. I don't trust you as my counselor, because anything that I said to you, you are a Monday reporter, you're going to call my PO or you're going to call ACS on me.\u201d So, you have both.", "3069": "Wow. That must be so difficult and challenging because when we think about the \u2026 I think it's called the school to prison pipeline, because we could realize that the systems that are in place now are taking men of color and taking them straight to jail. And it's all in a business sense to think about that. You're not feeling like as an individual that you don't deserve help or if you're just seen as a number or income.", "3070": "All those intersectionality of things that they face, but that's [crosstalk 00:48:48].", "3071": "And then depending on how many years, because in Rikers Island and in the prison system, it's not easy for you to seek medical attention. Yes, they do have a clinic. Yes, they do have a hospital, but it's just like, it can take you months in order for you to see a doctor. And when you see a doctor, they usually said, \u201cOh, they're giving me a Silenor.\u201d", "3072": "So, if someone gets arrested, right? And let's say they have all these pills that they take daily, like if it's [inaudible] certain meds or cholesterol, is there like a screening in intake when you're getting locked up, like, \u201cHey, what are your health conditions?\u201d Is it like that? Because imagine someone who needs this to help their body and they don't have access to it and they're going to get ill or possibly die.", "3073": "On paper, it is. Now, if it happens, that's another story, but on paper, yes. They do need to \u2026 An intake has to be completed, like a physical has to be done and that's including either a TB test or the chest X-ray if they had a reaction to one before. And then they do have a discharge planning team that worked with you with your HIV, or if you want intake of hormone.", "3074": "So, on paper, yeah. If it happens, that's another story.", "3075": "Wow. Thank you for that specialty. [inaudible] something, this is that industry. It's just a sect of the community that we really don't know about and there's so many people, young people that get locked up for years and how we experience our bodies going through things, imagine them without having direct supporters or providers. We go, when we need it and imagine them not having it and they have these long-term conditions.", "3076": "But wow, it's something to think about. Thank you, Yara and [crosstalk 00:50:44].", "3077": "No problem.", "3078": "Caesar. The question is \u2026 I know, okay.", "3079": "I lost track real quick and I was like [crosstalk] again?", "3080": "What are you learning \u2026 I'm sorry. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to your, or your community's health and wellbeing. Share a story from your experience that will help us understand a little better.", "3081": "Okay. Well, the area that I live in \u2026 that I'm currently living in right now, on the upper West side, I'm not too familiar with the healthcare system in this area, because I don't know if you guys know, but this is the area that's very expensive. And so, I don't have any providers in this area.", "3082": "So, the providers that I have are downtown, because when I end up \u2026 I go to an LGBT I guess, friendly, what would you call it? Clinic, hospital and whatnot. My doctor actually is a trans female, which I didn't ask for it. It just happened that way. And I just thought that was super cool, because like, I feel like, \u201cOh great.\u201d I feel comfortable, instead of having, like when I was younger, just the typical doctors I usually get like heterosexual, they don't know too much about LGBT stuff or related issues, they just ask the basic things about you.", "3083": "But I feel like with my provider and like where I go, I feel very comfortable. You feel like you \u2026 It's like almost like family and you're with somebody who can relate with you on so many levels and you can talk to them about different things than you would be if you would be comfortable with a heterosexual doctor.", "3084": "And it's a small place too, so they don't have so many clients where somebody is just a number. So, I kind of really like that about my medical providers. I've never really tried to have a medical provider in my area, but I just love the fact that there is \u2026 I think you mentioned it before, there is like those medical providers, whether it's mental health, whether it's other type of medical stuff that are LGBTQ friendly and are themselves.", "3085": "And I think that's very important for our community and they should have more of that. And I think there's more and more that are turning up and showing up in different communities around the United States. And I think that's so, so, so important because there's people who are depressed and who don't have those providers or those services available nowhere near where they live and they're nowhere near their communities and they would have to go miles and miles away if that's what they wanted, you know?", "3086": "But I think for that community, it's such a safe haven and a safe place to just walk inside somewhere and not be judged and be like, \u201cOh my God, I'm here with people like me.\u201d And I think that's very important for communities and I'm just glad that I have that resources for myself. Does that answer the question?", "3087": "Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I feel that's so important because [inaudible] through the lens of having LGBTQ providers, but I have a question for Yara. Sometimes, do you single out and want to use like a woman, a female doctor over a male doctor, or a woman of color over a white provider? Do you feel like those things are important to you when you select because of this, more of, relation or relating they can understand more?", "3088": "Not for me, but for my mom, I do. For my mother, it is because she feels comfortable because of the language. She likes to go to Dominicans' doctors. She don't care if they are like male, female, but they have to be Dominican. In her mind it's like, she can relate more and when they're explaining to her, her conditions, it's more like in a dear language or medical language that it kind of click to her.", "3089": "When it comes to me, I haven't had good experience when it comes to females. So, I feel more comfortable with a male, believe it or not. Honestly, I don't really go to my PCP. I just go for referrals. So, I'm good just making a phone call, send me the paper then I go to my specialist because of my health conditions. But no, I don't mind, but for my mom, they have to be Dominicans.", "3090": "I want to say something. It's kind of funny, because I tend to like going to women doctors. And it's because I always get a sense that they care more. There's more compassion when I'm being checked on. But then the sense of a male knowing my body because they share the same physical self.", "3091": "[inaudible 00:56:40]?", "3092": "Huh?", "3093": "What do you mean?", "3094": "They share the same [crosstalk 00:56:47]. Yes, yes. But yeah, I don't know. Sometimes I get \u2026 I don't know. It's weird with that situation with me, you know?", "3095": "Yeah. That's so interesting. I have made mention like my dermatologist, right? He's a man of color, because I feel like he will understand more with pigmentation issues and that's something that I said, I must have a man of color who understands that my skin blemishes easily because the melanin that's radiating now on the screen. Okay. Andy, are you ready to go? All right, go ahead.", "3096": "Okay. My mom raising us always took us to the doctor. We were always there and we would just be sick of it, because how regular it would be. So right now, I generally go to the doctor like this, every three months and it's because my mom, her sister had passed away from cancer and it was because my grandma never took them to the doctors.", "3097": "And the doctor had said like, \u201cHad you guys been coming to the doctor regularly, it could have been stopped earlier on.\u201d So, that really stuck with my mom and she always gives us those reasons. So, right now I'm living in her house, but originally like a few \u2026 two weeks ago, I was living in Brooklyn and I'd been living there for almost two years. So, I was still keeping up with going to the doctor just because mentally, it just makes sense like, why wouldn't you go?", "3098": "But I also have insurance through my mother. I know a lot of young people don't have insurance and it's either because they don't think they need it or they don't care about it, or some people just don't want to where to get it, because sometimes it is pricey, but there's plenty of resources for people, it just takes the person to want to go and do it.", "3099": "But wait, sorry. I got off on that trail. Something else that I wanted to bring up. I work in fashion and a lot of people that I work with in New York come from other countries. So, when they come here and they're on visas and I don't know, it's the same thing and they always kind of just blame it on the prices of it. And I think that's kind of interesting.", "3100": "Wait, what else was the full question? Can you repeat it?", "3101": "No, I think \u2026 No.", "3102": "What else? What affects me positively about what my neighborhood brought to me and things?", "3103": "Your community.", "3104": "Yeah, my community. While I was living in Brooklyn during my first part of my lockdown, for me, it didn't really feel like anything changed. I've been vegetarian since I've been five. So, for me, I was always eating tofu and just other non-meat things. So, living in that area where it was kind of getting so gentrified and there was all these places, it was really convenient for me in terms of also supermarkets that would have just tons of sections of food that I needed to eat.", "3105": "But now that I'm in Queens and I'm closer out to Long Island, it's really interesting the difference in quality of things that are in the supermarket, like the juice section is like, juice with like tons of sugar in it. So, it's like, I can't find like a good like vegetable juice or something, so I'm going to have to like run my own, which takes work, but I'll do it.", "3106": "But I don't know. I'm going to see how this part of my lockdown affects how I nurture my body. One thing that my boyfriend and I did, we ordered, what is it called? Green something? It was like a delivery food service. So we're trying it for two weeks to see what it's like. But I don't know. Does that kind of answer all the different things [inaudible] right now?", "3107": "No, interesting. You kind of answered another question that we're going to get to, but yeah, you did it. Why not? A family's influence is very part of that to the decisions we make relative to healthcare. Thank you, Andy. [inaudible] Michael Monroe?", "3108": "A slip up there. Could you repeat the question? I figured if I heard enough answers, I'd understand the question and I'm still not getting the question.", "3109": "Well, what in the community \u2026 [inaudible] defined community as different things, not necessarily your neighborhood, right?", "3110": "Right.", "3111": "In the community, it's [inaudible 01:01:43], what are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to your, or your community's health and wellbeing [inaudible 01:01:51]. Give a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "3112": "I'm not really sure. It's a very good question. Honestly, I don't know if I have an answer for that. There's so many things that influence on \u2026 I'm sorry?", "3113": "Well, sorry. I think you're out of this New York city-based group. You're a trans man, so maybe you could talk about acts of healthcare in Florida [inaudible] in New City.", "3114": "Oh, for sure. Yeah, because that's one thing, because I I've been to a few doctors in New York, but it's not \u2026 I grew up in Florida. So, I guess you could say that's where I would have my main experience when it comes to healthcare. I grew up not just in Florida, but in the part of Florida where you can honestly walk to Alabama, honestly. It's not that far away. I guess you could say pretty country, pretty redneck.", "3115": "So, the access to doctors that understand you or understand your community really isn't vast. I'm not really sure how to answer it because, I don't know. Most of the doctors here are older \u2026 not here, excuse me, where I grew up are older. Most of the doctors are straight, they have this Christian mindset because it's just where they call it the Bible belt where I'm from.", "3116": "Did they ever talk about sexual health with you [inaudible 01:03:33]?", "3117": "No. That conversation never happened. Well it was definitely a shock moving to New York, what was it? Seven years ago? I think six, seven years ago. Something like that. When I first moved, it was definitely a shock because that conversation was almost all over moving here. But when I was in Florida, that conversation was never had \u2026 not never had, but they ask you in a questionnaire, if that makes any sense. Like, are you having sex? Are you wearing protection? That kind of thing.", "3118": "But it was never \u2026 I don't know how I can explain it. It was obviously not in the interest of them or it wasn't a focus of theirs. So, I'm not sure how to answer it. I don't know. I'm having a hard time answering that.", "3119": "No, I think you did. How different communities vary when we talk about [inaudible] how their values are more liberal and when you talk about sexual health or [inaudible] versus [inaudible] belt Bible belt, where they're looking at sexuality as a form of something that's equivalent with marriage and those values.", "3120": "Yeah. Also, there aren't that many resources, I guess you could say for LGBT, but especially for people who identify as trans. I remember hearing not too long ago, literally. I don't want to say a year or two ago. I remember my friend, who's still in Florida telling me a story about how there was a kid who identified as trans male at the high school I went to, not allowed in his prom because of the outfit he was wearing. it didn't, I guess you could say, identify with what they expected him to wear.", "3121": "So, that was an issue, that he wasn't allowed in his prom because he wasn't wearing a dress because he was born female. So, the fact that that's still a conversation, still even a debate is sad. But that just goes to show you the lack of resources and education in the healthcare system, not just healthcare, like just in general, they're definitely behind.", "3122": "[inaudible 01:05:56]. Thank you for that. [inaudible] have a unique experience [inaudible] people of color and it is so and so [inaudible] necessarily have [inaudible 01:05:59]. Thank you. Now, I just want to shift the conversation more into community in regards to COVID itself.", "3123": "The next question is, what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resilience in the pandemic that you will like others to understand. Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. I'll read that again.", "3124": "What are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in the pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. The community that I spoke about when I first answered the question was in regards to the LGBTQ community.", "3125": "And when the pandemic hit, we realized that many providers has ceased services altogether. When I say we, I'm talking about out of my closet organization I'm a part of. And we realized that not having access and resources to clothing, because stores were closed and homeless youth don't have access to resources.", "3126": "They don't have money to buy things online, even thrift stores are not available for them to have resources and we had to consider several things. One being that there was a season change, that probably March has different weather than it is now. So, that's one thing that runaways living on the street have, the only thing that they managed to fit in a book bag and carry with them, also not having a shelter or a place where they can launder their clothes.", "3127": "So, I feel like what was great about the work of the organization is that we said, you know what? Despite of what's happening, amidst Corona, that we are stepping up and providing resources to these communities, even if it was putting ourselves at risk. So I feel like there is a sense of fostering and nurturing and taking care or looking out for the most vulnerable within our population, knowing that as LGBTQ people who still have resources, there's still a spectrum of those who are now dealing with being homeless LGBTQ, are now dealing with the pandemic.", "3128": "So, if we could offer a support, I think it spoke volumes to those communities that really need it. And we said that we normally have one or two popups per month, but altogether within the pandemic, we have 11 popups in such a short period of time and scheduled for another one in July.", "3129": "So, I think that's so important that we realize that there are other people within our spectrum who are not facing the pandemic to a different level and we have to be mindful of those communities. So, that's my answer. Chris?", "3130": "Repeat the question?", "3131": "Sure. What are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in the pandemic, that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that help us understand this a little better?", "3132": "Okay. I think for me what I witnessed before the whole furlough stage for me was, a lot of people were going through a mental health crisis. And as time went on, a lot of other individuals were saying that they were going through mental health crises; individuals that I wasn't even aware had mental health disorders. And I'm not entirely sure why some individuals we're no longer seeing their therapists or their psychiatrists. I am aware that some places were still open and some doctors were still seeing their patients, but I don't know where the disconnect was, where there were a lot of individuals that were not getting their prescriptions or not getting their medications.", "3133": "And I think a huge part of that community was lost because isolating yourself for someone that has anxiety or depression sometimes is not the best. And I think, not to say that some of them were forgotten about because I understand the whole situation that's happening and isolating yourself is one of those things that we needed to do. But maybe like phone conferences, maybe something along those lines that were happening where they were still getting some type of human interaction.", "3134": "Because even after my whole furlough state there were clients still calling me, explaining to me that they still needed people to talk to. Explaining that they needed to let out some of their emotions or their feelings because they had no one. And living by yourself and not having family, which a lot of my community faced was just being isolated and being alone and not having that support system.", "3135": "And again, they felt lost. This right here is just spreading the light on that. I don't know anybody else who witnessed individuals saying, well, I'm going crazy. And then when you're looking at it from a different point of view, you're like, okay, you're just overacting. But it's like some of these people are really going through situations where it's like their depression is really getting high, their anxiety is really getting high. So I just really wanted to spread light on that because I think it was really important to touch base on.", "3136": "Yeah, that is important. There are several things that you said that just are having light bulbs go up on everyone. I was saying that being confined in a space where you're restricted, some people who are extroverted, who like being out, who like being in nature, that's their sense of de-escalating from stressors, and that adding to not having access or not knowing what your future has for income is another stressor or being displaced or put out from your residence because there's no income coming in your family unit.", "3137": "Now you're like, I have to figure out all these added stressors. So the pandemic brought all of these things to the equation. I could definitely imagine people who are dealing with that and so much more. And then the whole idea of having therapy, so for me I like being in a place where I'm able to share face to face, rather digital. So imagine people who were so used to that preference, speaking with a counselor, rather than this medium. I feel the digital age is something that young people are more apt to engage in.", "3138": "But people who are much older who sit down in the therapist's office and that's their quiet space will just be very vulnerable. And then imagine not having access to WiFi or a computer or a phone, those are other things that will help. But that's that. So Andy mentioned a little bit about his community and access, but your take on their community's response, Andy.", "3139": "So I lived in Bushwick and literally two blocks from us was one hospital where there was so many people dying. And I remember going out on a walk and being one block away and seeing the ... It was just tense that they wouldn't put people in. It was really crazy. I don't know. Personally I think that in Bushwick people really didn't take it as seriously say they could have because I would go out early in the mornings to go for a walk so I wouldn't be near people and there would be so many people outside. So there would be a lot of people, a lot of POCs out and they wouldn't be wearing any mask or they would be on their stoops having beers and just doing whatever. It was just really regular.", "3140": "And towards the end of me living there, and it was getting warmer and warmer, it just encouraged more and more people to be outside. So it was even like the next block over this guy was making Salvadorian food, selling it out of his window, had a bench in front of his house, had the stoops ready for people to sit. I'm telling you definitely not six feet apart, definitely not wearing any masks because how do you eat food wearing a mask? I don't know, it was really weird. And I didn't know, do I report it? I definitely wasn't going to go and eat there myself but it was really weird.", "3141": "I think to just really see the dynamic of dead people on the street then the next block over people just eating like it was a regular day. I know some of my friends handled it very well. The roommate that I lived with at the time, I don't know, he still kept going out. It was like the second week of lockdown and he was at his friend's house having dinner. So it was something that bothered me. I don't know. I think in Bushwick, also in that area, there's a lot of young people and a lot of people who don't come from New York and a lot of ...", "3142": "So it was just a clash of everything, I think. And even I took it so seriously. There was people ... So we lived on like a three floor building so the whole block was like that all the way around and the first floor had backyard. So my room was in the back window and the apartment across from us everyone from the apartment building would go and hang out in the backyard and they would have parties and stay up till like 4:00 AM. It was really weird. I understood they were all staying together, but I don't know, I'm sure there was people that didn't live there coming in and out.", "3143": "And it just felt really, I don't know, it felt really weird. We, as a whole definitely weren't ready to handle anything like this, but I think a lot of people could have tried harder. But yes. Does that answer the question?", "3144": "It do.", "3145": "I'm going to continue to talk about the community that I work with, and honestly I got to say in a way I'm really happy for the support that the woman's has been receiving when it comes from some city agencies and nonprofit. So what we did it was that we created a group of certain seats and we made sure that ... Like Chris said at the beginning, yeah, we all were going crazy. Imagine us that we don't, in a way we don't have any mental health issues, even though sometime we do, but we are the strong person there to support them and we were going crazy.", "3146": "So I can just imagine them when they don't know how to deal with the situation, how they were feeling. So what we did was that we made sure that we provide a phones to all the clients, that way they had the [SUM] connections to the different organizations that were going to be supporting them. Another thing that the mayor's office did it's that they created a kit, including a laptop. So if you was coming out of Rikers Island you was receiving a laptop, just being released from Rikers just to make sure that you get in contact with your PO or different agencies that were going to support you throughout this process.", "3147": "So we also have paid eight weeks internships. So you do it from home. SUM calls every day, five hours and you get paid, regular paid for eight weeks. So when it comes to my community, I'm really happy because we've been there to support them, to guide them, provide them food when needed and connect them to groups and support groups. And even us, the staff, we have been doing support groups, even for us just to talk about everything that's happening right now in the last few weeks. So I am really happy with the response when it comes, again, city and nonprofit.", "3148": "And I am not glad that this happened, but this has shown that when we want to do it, we can do it. I think that it's ... Now we feel that, I can feel now that I can go to any agency or I can go to any of my colleagues and I know they're going to be there to support me. Before it's like, yeah, you know that there's resources there, we don't really use them, but now it's like we all came together. I remember at the beginning I was receiving phone calls from different agencies just to make sure that they had my right contact information to provide to clients.", "3149": "So it was like, why we didn't do that before? Why we needed to wait for something to happen in order for you to create like a bank or like a list of give out to clients and know that you have people that can support them? So when it comes to that response, I'm happy and hope that even when all this happened, that we can continue doing the work that we're doing now.", "3150": "Super, super, super. I agree. We had to mobilize quickly and we were still learning how best figure this out and they're still ... We're a big city with lots of money so imagine other communities or people who are not in this area, who have less access and so scared out of their own minds. Thank you, Caesar.", "3151": "Yeah. So I guess from what I've seen, my perspective is very interesting because the area that I'm in is very mixed as far as like if you go a few blocks this way it's very different, if you go a few blocks this way, it's very different. So if you go a few blocks downtown, there's like a whole, like near Signature projects over there, and then if you go a little East ... Because I'm in between Harlem and Upper West side, I'm like right in the cusp of both. If you go East there's a whole set of projects over there. And I have friends who live in those projects in both end.", "3152": "I have family and friends who live where I'm at. And also I live a few blocks away from Central Park, so I kind of see a lot of the outing stuff that's going on. So people who hang out in front of the projects and people who are taking their kids and family to walks in Central Park, which I do sometimes because I'm the type of person who needs to go outside and go for a walk and just ... That's my Zen, go for a solo walk and just zone out away from everybody else. But I've noticed that a lot of people in the projects that are hanging out on the corners, are hanging on street, none of them are wearing masks.", "3153": "And it's very concerning because it's like, all these people are ... They conjugate on the corners and then they go to their local stores that everybody else is going to, and it's not a safe feeling. Especially when you're trying to be safe and you're like, \"Oh, I'm going to wear a mask every time I go outside, every time I go inside of a business.\" You're trying to protect yourself and the people around you, but then you have groups of people who are not doing it who are intermixing with neighborhoods and communities in the same area.", "3154": "So it's a little frustrating when you see that. But also a lot of businesses and almost all of them now are mandating that you wear a mask when you come in. They're literally stopping you at the front door if you're not wearing a mask. And I feel like that makes me feel good and that makes me feel safe, and I think it's good for the community. All the stores have the tapes outside of the store so you can stand six feet apart. They have a front door person, like, \"Okay, two people came out, two people can come in.\" They're monitoring it and managing it pretty well now.", "3155": "But in the beginning we were all blind. We don't know what's going on, we don't know what the right thing to do is, we don't know how people properly contract it. Does it stay in the air, does it not stay in the air? You know what I'm saying? So now that a lot of more information is out, I feel like my neighborhood is taking the proper precautions, but still a lot of the younger people in the areas that are on my block or around my block, I don't see a lot of them wearing masks. If you look out the window right now you'll probably see a bunch of people hanging out and giving pumps to each other, no mask, hugging and conjugating it.", "3156": "These are not people who all live in the same apartment where I understand, and it's concerning when you're walking down the street with your family and you're trying to protect yourself. It's tough because then that makes you want to stay inside more and protect yourself. I actually have a friend of mine, they're a couple, they have not been outside since the pandemic started for three months.", "3157": "What?", "3158": "They have not been outside, not one time. They order their food. They bought a washer and a dryer, so they don't have to go out and do laundry.", "3159": "Whoa.", "3160": "They order their groceries. They don't go outside for anything. And it's scary that some people are like this to that extreme. And it's really mind boggling that he's really terrified to go outside. I was like, \"Hey, I wanted to come and see you.\" \"Oh well, you can come through the window and say hi but I'm not opening the window.\" And I'm like, \"Oh good, I get it. I totally understand?\" But he refuses ... Yeah, exactly. He refuses to go outside. And I totally get it, but me I'm the type of person I need fresh air and I go for my walks, but I go ...", "3161": "In the beginning of it I used to wear gloves every time I'd go outside. Even if I didn't go to like a store I just wore gloves just because I didn't know how you can get it.", "3162": "I understand.", "3163": "Yeah. But I definitely still, I wear mask, especially when you go into other establishments, because it's for your safety and others. But I see a lot of younger generation are not really doing it around my neighborhood.", "3164": "Thank you. I do understand that though, because having ... All those things cost money. I saw they were signed, you know those blue disposable mask, like $4. I'm like what?", "3165": "They sell it in my neighborhood downstairs in the local deli for $7.", "3166": "That's horrible. And people don't have the access income to get these mask. That's so bad.", "3167": "And the alcohol bottles that cost like what 2.99, they're selling them for like $8. It's so crazy.", "3168": "I think it's [inaudible 01:26:04]. And finally, it's, I'll call him Monroe.", "3169": "It's LaKesha. You have to change my name, it's just LaKesha now. I don't know how to honestly answer this question, because, Mike, you know how I feel about COVID honestly, so I don't know how to respond to that.", "3170": "Okay. Thank you.", "3171": "I know that my response may come across irresponsible, I guess. So I don't know if I should answer.", "3172": "The concept of the conversation is to hear variable different ideas so I would love to hear what you have to share. And then I promise after Michael goes, we'll take a quick break for water, to let in water or let out water. I basically have one more question and then we're pretty much do. All right, go. What do you feel? And this is an open environment, we're not going to judge you, we're going to learn to listen.", "3173": "Yeah, because I'll fight somebody. I definitely feel that COVID is, obviously it's real. I known many people who have lost somebody from it so obviously it's not made up. I know that for a fact that that's obvious. But moving past that part, I do believe it's exaggerated. I do believe we don't need to be taking as many precautions as they say we do. One minute it's airborne, the next minute it's not, then it's airborne again. I find it funny that you have to wear a mask outside but when you are inside your home you don't have to, as if COVID can get in your home for some reason.", "3174": "It's perfectly fine to work in a liquor store but churches have to stay closed because COVID can't get inside a liquor store. There's a lot of things that I have issues with that I think we're overdoing a lot of precautions. I think a lot of it is unnecessary, but I'm totally fine with the better safe than sorry, angle, but not everyone ... So many people are out of work now and it's just getting ridiculous because not everyone can just afford to stop what they're doing. Some people, they literally live, like me for example, literally live day to day, paycheck to paycheck, every single dollar matters, and telling someone they can't go to work because we're all being a little, I can't find the word for it.", "3175": "I just think it's a lot. I think that's more dangerous than not wearing a mask.", "3176": "[inaudible 01:29:02], thank you for sharing.", "3177": "Yes. You're welcome. It's now 1:06, we're going to take a quick three minute break to, I guess, gather water or some to use the bathroom, and then we'll just resume at 1:09. Okay? Cool? You guys understand?", "3178": "Do we leave and come back or how do we-", "3179": "I'm just going to-", "3180": "Oh, you were saying Michael, and then Chris has something to say.", "3181": "Yes, I'll repeat this part. To elaborate on how I felt about COVID, of course it's a legitimate thing, obviously. I myself got sick earlier in the pandemic, but I don't ... They talk about how 96% of the cases are mild and you can just go home and if that's the case why are we still home or not still home, but why are we told to stay home if it's so bad? With me working in PR and marketing I've been in multiple conversations regarding how COVID could be used as a form of marketing now to sell a product.", "3182": "As long as we mention that we require masks, as long as we mention that we offer free hand sanitizer or you get this or this and that, it's now a way of selling a product of. As long as we continue to make people paranoid and just feeling they're going to die of COVID, we could sell them something", "3183": "The products you're talking about masks and I guess antibacterial, antiviral agents? Is that what are the two things? Because if you think of the scope of things, then what happens when reverts ... There's also the COVID testing, that medical aspect, and in addition there's also been a [inaudible] on treatment, we'll [inaudible] to vaccine or suffer vaccine. Or you indicate that people are positive or negative or have the antibodies.", "3184": "This, like any virus, will take its course and then a modality of treatment will have to be researched. But what other products are you thinking about [inaudible 01:31:13]?", "3185": "By product I don't mean just a literal sense of something you can hold, whether it's a service you're selling. If you're a restaurant trying to bring in a customer, just slapping a sign on the door that says, \"Masks required,\" that makes people feel safe so obviously people are going to walk inside and eat at your restaurant versus a restaurant that doesn't require a mask. So I feel like a lot of people, they don't believe it just as much as the next person. I feel like it's easier to sell whatever your product is, whether you're a bar owner or if you're trying to sell, I don't know, anything.", "3186": "I just felt like using COVID as a marketing ploy is easy now, and so many people are taking advantage of that. I've been in so many conversations about that. And also people, the people who ... This is why I was hesitant on bringing this up is because a lot of times people that say \"I don't believe in COVID\" or just something along those lines, they get cast out or people get angry at them or they get canceled, like people in media. So I feel like a lot of people are afraid to say that and they just go with the flow and pretend they agree with it just because they don't want to ... They fear the negative feedback.", "3187": "I understand that. Chris, your said you were very active.", "3188": "Oh no, no, I was messing around with my words.", "3189": "That makes no sense.", "3190": "[inaudible 01:32:44]. All right, any other remarks in regards to Michael Monroe's statement before we [inaudible 01:32:52].", "3191": "I think that it's true about what you're saying people are taking advantage of what it is, but at the same time it's like people really don't know and it affects people differently. So I think it is just for the better good of everybody. A friend of mine, his mother died and he couldn't even be with her in the hospital, and they had to cremate her. So I think it's case by case in a way, but there are so many people affected, myself included. I didn't get unemployment until just a few weeks ago and it was a process for me. I'm a freelancer and I really ...", "3192": "I had like a little bit of money saved because I was planning to move in the summer so I was able to be safe, but it really ... I don't know. I agree though, a lot of people are amplifying it because I myself I did a photo shoot where I had a ... We did it upstate, because upstate opened before upstate and Long Island opened. So the photographer had a house upstate and the entire time we had to wear masks. And my job, I work with the clothes. I'm usually so used to dressing people and putting things on them and touching and so much, so it was really hard to, I don't know, try to figure that out.", "3193": "[inaudible 01:34:33].", "3194": "But I think they're ... I'm just saying there's in certain work situations and for certain people, I think, yeah, it's fine to interact. But I think if you personally feel like you're really going to be affected like your friends do and they just want to be inside, then I feel like they should leave it up to people to decide in a way. I guess, yeah, making it mandatory is a bit aggressive, but people who have had to go to work are still going to work and have been doing so since it started. So I don't know. I wish it was a little bit lighter, but I guess it's understandable at teh same time why it [inaudible 01:35:16].", "3195": "Just because some people really are ... Just another example, this girl I know she, she's staying with her parents to keep them safe. They're aging and they have really strong language barrier, they don't really know a lot of English. So they watch Korean news, but what they're reporting there is differently from what's going on where they're living, which is in White Stone, Queens. So she literally has to tell her parents not to do things and not to go out. And they're still not paying attention. They'll go and grab the mail and put it on the table and not disinfect it or wash their hands because they're, I don't know.", "3196": "So it's just really, I think, case by case or person by person. It should be up to our decision if we feel. But I do agree that really big spaces and events and things, people really shouldn't be gathering if it's more than 10 people, you know what I mean? Only if you guys are really like can't do your work. I think it's smart to close social situations and restaurants. I don't think we should be allowed to be eating together because we have to go to the bathroom.", "3197": "I don't know, you come in contact with so many people, the server who's bringing you the food, Whereas where the restaurants closed the person's wearing a mask and glove and just handing you a plastic bag that came from the back from somebody who we assume are being clean. So I don't know.", "3198": "I just think that-", "3199": "It's just a back and forth argument where we're seeing-", "3200": "Right. I just think that right now none of us are wearing a mask while we're doing this, and it's funny because what I find hilarious about that is if COVID is airborne, it can get in our home. It can get through a door, it can attach to our clothing. And if it's so deadly, why aren't we wearing a mask right now to protect ourselves from this virus that's in the air? So that's the thing that I find really interesting. But I do agree that it should be up to us, like you said, to certain groups or certain precautions.", "3201": "There's plenty of states that are fully open up to 25% capacity. So I feel like that's how it should be because not everyone can afford to just stop working. And so many people were denied unemployment because of their work is full time freelance, they don't have W2s or 1099s or anything like that to prove they've done anything, so whether you're-", "3202": "I was nervous myself as well, because I'm a freelancer and sometimes people just pay me on Venmo and I have to think twice about like, oh, I'm going to calculate this to make sure I pay the tax for it. I guess I don't know if I should offer that, Michael. But it's just like in reality it's what's happening, and in reality there's more of us than there are people working. I don't know, this kind of goes off topic, but like in unemployment. So it's really interesting how it's going to come back to people who are getting employment and making money and all that.", "3203": "New York City is predominantly people who work paycheck to paycheck. I can't remember the percentage, I just know it was high when I read that. Most people in New York City, we need our job. And then when the state says, \"Hey, you can't go to work. You have to stay home,\" it limits your options. Of course we're, you and I, we're freelance work, but the type of freelance, that still gets cut in time.", "3204": "[crosstalk] it's still like I'm sure people who are sex workers they can't do what they need to do to survive beyond Only Fans, which is really actually hard to get a good following on, where you make ample amount of money.", "3205": "Did you say Only Fans?", "3206": "Exactly. He said Only Fans.", "3207": "Because I have brought up sex workers. Sex workers have to come in contact with their clients.", "3208": "Absolutely.", "3209": "I thought you said social workers.", "3210": "No, I said [inaudible 01:39:32].", "3211": "Okay. Not sex workers.", "3212": "No, because social work is similar to therapy, a lot of people are doing just online, things like that.", "3213": "Videos, yeah.", "3214": "And AA groups and things like that. But I'm just saying there's real jobs like that, real people that do that and I'm sure it's affecting them. I'm just saying you can't just have an online presence and immediately start making money.", "3215": "Exactly. Yeah.", "3216": "And everyone's doing, it's so saturated. You know what I mean? We all know what vaginas and penises and breasts look like you know what I mean? And it's like how are you going to get people to look at you online when you can just go on a phone app for free or like other free resources for stuff? I don't know, it's just a completely [inaudible 01:40:27].", "3217": "I need him back to plug his website.", "3218": "I think it's so sad actually that individuals, freelancers like yourselves just got forgotten about and it was just like they were like, \"Okay, well, we'll help out the people that worked, but the people that are freelance, whatever, figure it out.\" And the kind of stuff [inaudible 01:40:48], there was no services or no anything in place for those individuals, especially in New York where there's a lot of people that do modeling and photography and things. That's crazy.", "3219": "I have friends who work for brands, designing clothes, that literally the first week of the lockdown they lost their jobs and then they had to move back to whatever country they're from because they don't have a work visa, they're not working for that company. So I literally had friends who had to pack things up in a matter of days and leave. It really [inaudible 01:41:25].", "3220": "That's my issue with it.'", "3221": "We can't hear you. Michael, you're on mute.", "3222": "Am I on mute?", "3223": "[inaudible 01:41:37].", "3224": "Oh, sorry. I totally understand the better safe than sorry angle and I see it and I respect it, and I totally get where that comes from. But like you mentioned, your friends had to just up and leave, they can't afford to stay or they're not allowed to stay. There's so many things that we didn't think this through. We just said, \"All right guys, shut down.\" Boom. Who cares who gets hurt in the process? Who cares if people become homeless in the process?", "3225": "New York already has a ridiculous amount of homelessness so let's just add to it, why don't we? And then there's just a lot that I have an issue with, with that. But we only have so much time to talk about it, so I don't want it ... I can get into that in another Zoom call.", "3226": "All right, anyone else before we move on to the next? I'm so appreciative of the different variables of sharing our own personal experience. That's what this opportunity provided.", "3227": "Can I actually say something real quick?", "3228": "Yes.", "3229": "I'll try not to make it too lengthy. But my mom, she actually ended up contracting COVID. This was a few months ago, because she actually is an essential worker. I'm considered a social worker too for the airlines, but I just took one of the leaves that they offered, because I didn't want to be working in the airline industry while this was going on. So I'm on a leave, but my mom, she was an essential worker, she actually works at a homeless shelter. We have clients who are homeless and mental illness and drug addiction, so she had to go to work. There was no leaves offered for her.", "3230": "But two of her friends slash coworkers passed away that were working there, long time friends, like 10, 15 years, that they were kind of like family to her. And they both passed away. And apparently what the story is, was that they possibly contracted it at work because there's a lot of clients that live there on site and a lot of going in and out, and my mother possibly contracted it from the coworkers who had already passed away. They were hospitalized.", "3231": "They went on ventilators and everything and they passed away within days. My mother had it, and she thought she didn't have it. She didn't want to believe that she had it, but she had a call, and it was pretty ... It was just a consistent cough and I was like, \"Ma, I think you should go check it out. I'm not saying that you have anything, I'm just saying, just go get tested. What's wrong to get tested?\" But she was such full denial that she refused to get tested. \"I don't have it. I don't have it.\" Because she immediately assumed that once you have it you're dead, you're going to die.", "3232": "Because that's what happened to her friends. And I was just like, \"No, because you can be asymptomatic or be very mild and be able to pass it on. It doesn't mean you're going to die, it doesn't mean that you're going to get any worse. It's a possibility. You seem okay as far as health wise, you just have a cough, which means you could still have it.\" But she wasn't there regardless. I ended up contracting it from her and I lost my sense of smell and taste and I actually had a cough for a while. I never got a fever, I never got anything worse. I got tested.", "3233": "Well, I actually went to a local clinic who at the moment for some reason stopped doing testing. When I called a week ahead of time they said they were doing testing, so when I went they said they stopped doing testing because the [inaudible] told them not to do any more tests at the moment. I don't know why. But the doctor basically told me, \"You have it.\" Like, \"Oh yeah, you have the symptoms so you have it. So just act like you have it.\" I'm like, \"That's very unprofessional. You didn't even do a test, how can you just say that I have it?\"", "3234": "It happened to me.", "3235": "[crosstalk 01:45:42], what if I have really severe mental issues where I would have taken that like, oh my God, I'm going to die. What if I became suicidal because you told me I had COVID? So I really didn't like that. So I reported that that place. Supervisor called me [inaudible 01:46:01], oh, this is just [inaudible] he told us to tell people we don't have tests all the places needed or whatever. Which is fine because the same week my friends in Westchester went to their local clinic and got tested with no problem. And they said they're testing anybody who goes there.", "3236": "So I just thought that was very interesting how some places were testing, some places were not testing. But whatever, I self quarantine for two weeks and I actually called the department of health to make an appointment to get the free testing or whatever. They took a week and a half to contact me back for that appointment. I got the appointment, by the time I got tested I was negative. But my mom last week she got the anti, what is it, the antiviral test? Yeah. And she tested positive saying that she had it. So it was just a lot of that.", "3237": "But now since then, since her coworkers passed away, her job, the shelter, 50% of the occupancy, the clients, were removed and were put into hotels, which hotels are now turned into shelters. So they're living there now because in the shelter she's at they have to share kitchenette space and bathrooms and showers. So now that they're in the hotels they don't have to do that. So now she's going back to work or they'll do temperature tests of anybody who comes in and out and everybody has to wear a mask throughout the whole time that they're there.", "3238": "And they have not had a case since, but for the people that they took out, there was a lot of cases that people tested positive in there. So anybody who tested ... They had to test everybody in the building. Everybody who tested positive was removed. So it's still going on now where all those clients are still not back on site and it's pretty scary in the sense of like, \"Oh, your mom is still going to work in that place.\" I told her just try to take PTO or days off or whatever, but now they're have so many safety precautions in place that I guess it's a better, safer environment. I hope. But I just wanted to share that experience that I had.", "3239": "Yeah. I think it's important to address that because going off of what Michael said, I can see how it's been amplified so much as this big thing. But then when you hear the stories of like Caesar's experience, you see why it's so nerve wracking for individuals and how people are taking it serious because of situations that they have, that they're going through, that's hitting home. I also know two people that died from it. So it's just like ... And then there's no medication specifically for it. It's just like a whatever type of thing and you have to get over it when you do.", "3240": "There's a lot. And there's a lot that we know and there's a lot that we don't know. And I feel like the doctors and the media, we're just going to day by day, learning or trying to figure things out because they really didn't know what was going on. They really didn't know at all, what to keep precautions to place. And I feel like maybe that's why they put all these extreme measures because they were like they don't know. So we don't know how this really works, because the whole thing in the air, I don't think you can just get it that easily through the air unless somebody's really cough in front of you who has it.", "3241": "But how often does somebody cough in your face? Or touch things that people who have it, who don't know they have it, things like that. I feel like just taking your own safety precautions is all you really need to do. If you feel comfortable carrying around hand sanitizer and using it every 10 minutes, well, go ahead and do that. If you feel like wearing a mask and protecting yourself in public, then go ahead and do that. But I don't think it's 100% necessary when you're walking around in public. That's true. I have also been stopped when I was walking through the street and I just wanted ...", "3242": "I had my mask in my pocket, but before I even put it on they told me, \"You cannot enter or buy anything unless you have a mask.\" And I was like, \"No, it's okay. I have my mask, I'm going to put it on.\" And they're like, \"Oh, okay. Because if you don't have one, you cannot come in.\" And it's very extreme, and I totally get businesses are just trying to ... They don't know. Nobody knows. Nobody really knows a lot. So they're just being extreme. And I get it, it is frustrating and annoying. But I feel like in public, it's not ... In open space it's not.", "3243": "[inaudible 01:50:35]. I'm glad your mom's doing well, Caesar, and I am sorry for the lost lives. So those are just different things to consider. All right. So we're up to our last question guys, and this is an interesting segment because we're actually going to listen to a clip of someone who's going to share their feedback and then get comments to it. So just to read by script, now I'd like bring the voice of someone who participated in a conversation in the Local Voices Network recently, I want you to imagine that this person is in the room with us and listen closely to their comments.", "3244": "I'll then invite you to share any responses and insights you gained from listening to these comments. Alrighty?", "3245": "The first things that come to mind, just for the sake of time is just change, a systemic change in the way that we do things, from a top down level, from the big guys up there that make the decisions to the ones that that employ the services, just making sure ... There's no question that there is social economic and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels, and that it affects our health.", "3246": "And if we can do away with that, where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food, and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals, across the board, that if I'm walking down corona in my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care is as if I go to Park Avenue or Central park in in Manhattan.", "3247": "There's going to be no change, same quality of care there. That's the first thing that pops into my head.", "3248": "I was going to say that.", "3249": "So feedback on that clip, you agree, disagree, just general feedback", "3250": "It brings me back to what Andy was saying that when it comes to his food, that when he was in Brooklyn he was able to get healthier food, now that he's closest to New Orleans City, if I'm-", "3251": "[crosstalk 01:53:36].", "3252": "Huh?", "3253": "Queens, Long Island area.", "3254": "Okay. So now that he's here the juices now have more sugar on it. So that, it brings me to that because it's like in certain neighborhood, yeah, you'll be able to eat healthier and maybe you have more abilities to go to the doctors, maybe they do have all the equipment that you need for all your medical care needs. But now Andy is in this place that we know that now maybe we're going to be dealing with the kids with obesity, now the sugar problems since I'm a child because we don't have access to the food that we need.", "3255": "So that brings me back to that, like, yeah, can we get to a place that we across the country or across the state that we we all get the same treatment, that we all get the same quality of food or same quality of medical that we need.", "3256": "Sorry.", "3257": "I don't know. It's okay. It's okay. So going off of what y'all were saying, I think living in Brooklyn and having lived in the Bronx and Manhattan, you see the different type of individuals that are living in those communities and see the type of food that they're eating. And when I was living in Manhattan, we see a lot of the whole foods and we see a lot of the healthy foods where people were going and getting their groceries.", "3258": "But then you go to other areas in Brooklyn or the Bronx, and it's like, you don't have those stores available to you. And then we think about people's economic status and it's like they can't afford that healthy foods. So it's like where are we making sure that the public is, I guess, eating in a healthy manner or getting the nutrition that they need at the cost that they can, I guess, afford.", "3259": "Anyone else like the feedback?", "3260": "I agree that healthcare and the proper healthy foods should be available to everybody. I definitely agree with that, but I also feel like there's a market and a business that I feel like the companies feel like if they put a healthy food store in the middle of like a poor community, that the food is expensive and they're not used to eating, like they're not really going to buy it. But I feel like that's what needs to change.", "3261": "These communities need to know how to eat healthier as far as the education about it. This is what's important. They don't know that. If you go to the projects of the block, all you see is fried chicken spots, Chinese food, this is what they're used to. And then they go to the local stores and all they have is those sugary foods and they don't have as many vegetable options as the whole foods does five blocks that way. Because there is a whole foods over here and there's also a, what's the other one? I forgot. Trader Joe's.", "3262": "And they always have lines around the block, but look at the people who are on those lines. The people who are waiting on those lines to get on those stores are not the people who know and are educated about these foods, that why they're good for you and other alternatives too like the fried chicken food spot that has French fries and everything's fried and it's not healthy for you. I think it's about the change in the families, in the homes.", "3263": "Because being a Spanish person of color, we grow up eating rice and beans and platanos and all that stuff that's very high starch, high sugar. And sometimes that all the time is not good. And I think that I guess the new generation needs to, who are educated about it. Or even just bringing in those educational resources to the community is best. And I think a lot of that starts from the families in the homes, the schools that we're in, because the schools that we're in don't really teach that in those communities.", "3264": "And I think that's where it really ... The root. You need to go to the root of the source of the problem and why are people eating all these foods? And why the generation before that ate that food? This is what they know. And if they know about all the other healthier options, then that will be a higher demand for those communities. Oh, I don't want to eat fried chicken anymore, I actually do want to eat a salad or have just better alternatives. Then that will be a pattern that will continue.", "3265": "So I think that's where the education about it really needs to be more higher in the community.", "3266": "Do you feel it's more of education or is it access to financial resources? Because these change in having rice and beans, for example, as you said, the cost is way smaller than having to feed a big family than it is having other produce, like fresh produce.", "3267": "I think that if the demand in the community for healthier foods goes up, then I think businesses can maybe even come out with more affordable, healthier options for those communities. If let's say if a whole, from my perspective, if a whole community that's used to eating fried chicken, let's say nobody wants a fried chicken spot anymore, nobody wants to eat that local Chinese food anymore. Those businesses are going to go out so maybe healthier alternatives will start to come in because that will raise the money up.", "3268": "But again, I think it starts with the educational body, and I think if demand is there then the businesses will come.", "3269": "That's a strong point. I think in an ideal world that's what we would want, right?", "3270": "That's what we would want. Right.", "3271": "When Michael stated the access to it, I still think that people were not going to sit there and say, \"Oh, well, you know what, let me try to get a healthier option,\" when food is right there in their hands, it's cheaper. It's probably worse for you, but it's cheaper.", "3272": "That's what they're going to go for. Yeah.", "3273": "Right. And it should be, this healthy food should be accessible to everyone. Not just accessible, but also affordable.", "3274": "Yeah.", "3275": "I don't know. I get a little iffy with that because again, Andy mentioned earlier how he was, what, vegetarian or vegan?", "3276": "They're the same.", "3277": "Vegetarian. And I think he said he was a vegetarian since you were younger, right?", "3278": "Yeah.", "3279": "So it was things like that. I wasn't aware about vegan or vegetarian as a child. I wasn't warned of these things until I got older and I realized what it does to your health. Again, I think it does have to do with your education and what you want you in your household and at school, but as well as it being accessible so if I do want to try it I have the income to do so.", "3280": "And you don't have to take a whole train ride and a bus ride just to get those options. It shouldn't be that far.", "3281": "Andy, do you want to say something before I drop?", "3282": "No, I said I agree also. Sorry, there's car in front of my house that's [inaudible 02:01:01]. Hold on.", "3283": "Andy's hungry.", "3284": "Vroom. Vroom.", "3285": "I'm like what's going on?", "3286": "So I'll state my remark in regards to what I felt like the speaker was saying. In regards to coming up from the above, I'm also looking at corporations, but I'm looking at government as an influential agency over these places. Why isn't food cheap and why do we have money to invest more in military than into human lives? And if we look at the system of having a medicine, right? To have medicine, you have to have sick people. If people are better taking care of themselves, doing the right, what happens with the other aspects?", "3287": "So if you get a community sick by feeding them garbage or limiting their resources or access to healthier things, then you can make money by treating them. You see the correlation there?", "3288": "Yes. I definitely 100% agree with that, that if you are, like you said, making a community sick, it goes on to all these people saying, we need a cure for this, we need a cure for that. We do have a cure for it, but if we give it to you, then we make less money. We'll make more money by treating you versus curing you. I 100% agree with that.", "3289": "And are you guys, on that same thing, if we're looking at the government's impact or influence over community, do you feel like Medicaid for all having health insurance or more access to better healthcare systems? What do you think? Are you more prevention or [inaudible 02:03:01]? What's your call in the sense of that? Anyone? So with Medicare we have agencies offering healthcare services to everyone they have access.", "3290": "Should we have subsidized like food where everyone has food? Are food stamps enough for communities, for our under resourced. Chris you unmuted.", "3291": "No. Sorry. Your mic was cutting in and out on my end. So that's why I made a face because I didn't hear everything you said. Sorry.", "3292": "Sorry. It's quiet again in my neighborhood. But I agree that health care should be the same throughout because we are all humans. And even though some of us have different conditions or problems, at least the bare minimum could be that we all are treated with the same care or the same urgency that any one else gets anywhere else. And then you can keep going. Sorry, what's the other question?", "3293": "Oh, you were going to respond to that?", "3294": "If you repeat it again. I was getting onto it, but finally got quiet so I just wanted to say.", "3295": "So it was in regards to the government's influence over like food, how there is enough resources to supplement our military and invest there as opposed to investing in communities and having more of the agriculture corporations then. Change those or influence what we can get by not putting unhealthy additives like into turkeys, which they said has an addictive agent.", "3296": "Yeah. I think right now with everything going on with Black Lives Matter, that's a really good prime example to see where money can be distributed to really quickly when needed. So I think that's also why a lot of people are upset and that's a lot of the posts that I'm seeing too is that people are saying like, \"Oh, so you guys were able to get all this armor to protect police officers but you couldn't even get mask and gloves and disinfectant just for generally to everyone have.\"", "3297": "About the food thing, my grandma and my aunt, they live together and they've been ... They signed up for, I don't know what it's called, but my mum told me they signed up for something that the city's sending them food like once a week. They get a box of vegetables and other ingredients. I don't know. I haven't seen what's inside of the box exactly, but I can find out and then come back and let everyone know when I find out.", "3298": "I think I have a few people who signed up for that. It's like a New York City get food or something like that, and they send a box every three days. And then you have a choice of choosing, what did they say, it was like kosher food, like regular food, like you don't have a specific, kosher or vegetarian. And they say send a box, I guess, depending on what type of style of food that you want, but it's like every three days or a month because of the pandemic. And then you have to renew it every month if you want to continue to get it, if you're not able to ...", "3299": "It's supposed to be for people who don't want to go outside or can't go outside to get food so the city gives it to them for a fee. They change it up, what they deliver. They sent me the website before, I can probably get it if anybody [inaudible 02:07:00].", "3300": "[inaudible] like SNAP or how is it paid for?", "3301": "No. So if you have SNAP you actually can't sign up for it. You have to have no benefits I think from what I've read. Anybody can get it, literally anybody can sign up for it to get it.", "3302": "Free food?", "3303": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "3304": "Why didn't anybody tell me before we went on food shopping yesterday?", "3305": "So what's crazy is ... Who told me about it? It was my uncle. My uncle told me about it and I actually shared it with a few of my friends who need it, who actually really needed it in their families. So Michael, I'll send you the website, or if anybody wants it I can send you guys the website or whatever.", "3306": "He actually posted if you wanted to see. But has any more remarks before we just end? Super. So, do you guys have any questions?", "3307": "When does everyone think COVID's going to be over? What is everyone thinking?", "3308": "Next year?", "3309": "I think the effects of it are going to be over probably next year. Obviously, I feel like if let's say next month, everyone just reopens it's not going to get back to what we see as normal for a very long time. Even with businesses being fully open, people are still going to be weary about going out. They're not going to be sure if it's safe and things like that. So business is going to be slow for a while. And because of that reason, people aren't going to be as hiring in the volume that they were earlier in the year.", "3310": "So I feel like people are going to really still feel the effects of it for a good minute. I don't think it's going to be this year, I think it'll start getting back to normal next year.", "3311": "Yeah. Didn't think ... Sorry.", "3312": "No, go ahead, Chris.", "3313": "I was going to say, didn't they ... I know there's, what is it, the stimulus that everybody was getting? Doesn't that ... Isn't the date-", "3314": "Is that confirmed yet?", "3315": "No, they have not confirmed the second stimulus package.", "3316": "Okay. I'm sorry, the unemployment.", "3317": "The pandemic assistance amount ends on July 31st, the extra 600. So they haven't came to an agreement yet of what's literally going to happen right now after July 30th. So we don't even know ... It might not continue, but they're also thinking about giving bonuses for people coming back to work because they don't want people to ... A lot of people right now are making more money off of unemployment than their jobs, so people don't want to go back to work.", "3318": "So they're trying to do going back to work bonuses of 300 or $400 per week, if you go back to work. But again, nothing has been solidified.", "3319": "I haven't even gotten my unemployment confirmed yet. Mine I have to check in all the time. I haven't gotten nothing yet.", "3320": "When did you apply?", "3321": "I want to say the first or second week of ... So last week of March is when I stopped working, so April.", "3322": "Dude, that took long. I've been helping a lot of people get their unemployment because you have to call them. So you have to-", "3323": "I was on hold for three hours day before yesterday.", "3324": "Because I stopped working March 20th, and I applied the second week of April and I got it immediately. I was lucky, I will say that. But I had a friend of mine apply and he didn't get his till three weeks later. And it was only because he had one question that he answered on the application was different. They said they were going to call him back in 24 hours and they didn't. So he was literally waiting to hear from them, but once he called back, it was fixed like this. And yes, he had to wait for like three hours.", "3325": "My roommate just got hers yesterday, day before yesterday, I believe. And she's been waiting just as long as me so hopefully mine's sometime soon. So if she just got hers I shouldn't be that far after.", "3326": "But definitely call them because they're saying that they're going to call people to help and they're not doing that.", "3327": "The girl told me. She was like, \"I'm going to put you on hold and then I'll be right back.\" Three hours later, I think she just went out.", "3328": "Yeah, they're really horrible. My cousin, she's self employed, she runs an online business, and she didn't know that she can actually qualify for employment. So when I found that out that she could, which was like weeks away, weeks after, she applied for it and she got all the money we were told in one lump sum. So she got like [inaudible 02:11:39]. So the same thing might happen with you Michael Monroe, if you try to call. I actually had it happen to two people. I had it happen to two people.", "3329": "Yeah, I got my employment like a little bit over a month ago is when I started, but I applied at the end of March and last week or the week before I got my back pay and it was for all the weeks [inaudible 02:12:08].", "3330": "It's wild.", "3331": "I have a question on that. So, I know an individual that was working full time and they recently lost their job, maybe about two weeks ago, and then they got back pay from, I guess the beginning of April, the end of March. Is that normal for people? Because I was a little confused because if you're working full time when you go on unemployment, why would you-", "3332": "I don't know. You're not supposed to get unemployment if you're still working and claiming taxes. So if she is still working, I don't know what they're going to do because they're definitely ... I don't know ihey're going to come back for people or not. There are millions of people on unemployment. You what I mean? Are they going to ask even people who truly didn't work that they have to pay their money back in years to come?", "3333": "We don't know. But I feel like, I don't know, for your friend, Mike, I don't know, take the money now and deal with it later.", "3334": "I told the individual, I said, \"It's important to make sure that you have that money in your account and do not spend it because if they come back to you and ask you for that money back, because they-", "3335": "They can ask for it all back. Yeah, it happened to someone I know.", "3336": "They've also said, I read online that it's an automated system. That they spilled this money and that they may ask for the money back.", "3337": "During this pandemic, I don't know how they're keeping track of anything because I know people who are getting money from, like a family member who like passed away a long time ago and they're like using their information to get unemployment. How does the city not even know that they're dead? That's crazy.", "3338": "There's so much information being crossed left and right, there's no way-", "3339": "They use third party and fourth party companies to-", "3340": "The fact that I was left on hold for three hours shows you how many lines this girl had on her phone. That just tells you how crazy things are and how busy they are there. There's no way they're going to keep up with it. And I don't think they're going to follow up with any of that. And if they do then damn.", "3341": "Yeah, that's what I'm saying.", "3342": "Okay, everyone. Well, thank you so much for all your great feedback. I just have to read something to you before we end. You're more than welcome to continue the conversation we all have after I'm done. Just a reminder of what will happen with the thought ... I'm sorry.", "3343": "Hey girl.", "3344": "Okay. Just a reminder of what will happen with the thoughts you've just shared,, these recordings will be transcribed, indexed and eventually shared with journalists, public officials and participants is the Local Voice Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, that New York City municipal. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voice Network. If you want to convene another group of friends, participate in others, participate in our feeds go on to LVN network.", "3345": "And we were going to stop recording. But in addition, there's a little survey afterwards [inaudible 02:15:17]. So if anyone has any other questions, we're just going to stop recording. Nope. Cool. [inaudible 02:15:40].", "3346": "Sarah, you want to start? I'm Jazmin. I'm just here to support and potentially co-facilitate because Sarah and I both have children in our homes. And I see there are a lot... I see kids on screen, so we all know what that's like. So Sarah, I'm going to pass it to you.", "3347": "Hello everybody, and thank you so much for joining us today. I am very, very excited to be here. I am just pulling up the... bear with me, my computer froze. I'm just trying to pull up the script here that's going to help me facilitate this important conversation.", "3348": "Here we are. So I began recording at this time, and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded, and the audio will become part of the LVN Collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation: First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up voices and the needs of the communities to candidates, local policy makers and members of the media. To this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation. The Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you're invited to share the stories about your experiences with the health and well-being of your community, rather than sharing any personal health [information 00:02:10].", "3349": "This conversation is being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in the project, at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understandings of one another.", "3350": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere including other forms of media, so please share only what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public.", "3351": "If you understand and agree to this, please say \u201cI agree\u201d.", "3352": "I agree.", "3353": "I agree.", "3354": "Does everyone agree?", "3355": "Yes.", "3356": "Yes.", "3357": "Can we all say, \"I agree\"?", "3358": "I agree.", "3359": "Wonderful. Jazmin, is that everybody?", "3360": "Yes, we got everybody.", "3361": "Awesome. Great.", "3362": "Okay, so. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and to learn from others in this conversation, and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They\u2019re also on the materials that we sent with your confirmation email. I'm going to go over them just really briefly.", "3363": "One, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns. Four, stay curious, ask honest questions. Five, pause, take time for reflection. Six, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words do have an impact. Seven, when possible, close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications and put your phone on silent.", "3364": "Is everybody on board with these guidelines, or is there anything you would like to add or change?", "3365": "All right, it looks like we are all on board, that's great.", "3366": "So we're going to use a modified circle process where each person will take a turn. I'm posting the order in which people will be invited to respond in the chat box. I\u2019ll help transition us from one person to the next, and you can always say \"pass,\" or you can pass and ask for us to come back to you.", "3367": "Does anyone have any questions about that process?", "3368": "Jazmin, if you wouldn't mind, putting in the chat box just in order of how we're going to go around in the circle?", "3369": "All right, great. So to begin, we want to do a quick round of introductions. Please share your first name. In addition to your first name, can you share a little bit of background info about who you are, where you live, and/or what you do?", "3370": "And I'll go first. My name is Sarah. I work with the Child Wellness Initiative and I live in the North Shore of Staten Island. And I'm going to pass it to Jazmin and then she can pass it to the next person.", "3371": "Hi everyone, I'm Jazmin and I live on the North Shore of Staten Island but closer to mid-island. It's weird over here. And the next person up, Adria, I put you up just because I'm putting people in alphabetical order, if that's okay.", "3372": "I think this is alphabetical.", "3373": "I noticed that in chat. I'm Adria, I live in Staten Island and basically [inaudible] I have four kids and right now I'm doing Instacart, so that's [inaudible] and I'm just trying to make ends meet while supporting my family.", "3374": "Thank you, Adria. Ashley, you're next.", "3375": "Ashley [Santangelo] I live in St. George. I've been here for about eight years and I work as the leader for Staten Island's [inaudible] We're a relatively new non-profit on Staten Island so I [inaudible] mostly listen. I really want to learn about the priorities in terms of public health but I will also contribute, as a resident of Staten Island, I'm [inaudible] kind of... both personally and professionally. As I am in a lot of places on this island.", "3376": "Okay. We have Ebony, you're up next.", "3377": "Hi guys. My name is Ebony and those of you who know me, and don't know me, hello. I have my own business. I have two businesses. One is an adult business, and one is working with kids. And I'm an art teacher and I work with beautiful voluptuous kids. Yay! There you go. And I enjoy what I do.", "3378": "Thank you, Ebony. And Kristy, can you bring us home?", "3379": "Hello, I'm Kristy, I live on the South Shore, and yeah.", "3380": "Welcome, Kristy. Thank you. So our order, if you can't remember this I'll remind you, but it'll be Adria, Ashley, Ebony, Kristy, if that works for everyone. Okay.", "3381": "Sarah, you're on mute.", "3382": "Thanks, Jazmin. We do have one more question. I want to ask everyone one value that is important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today. And I'll pass it to Adria.", "3383": "I'm sorry, repeat the question. What is important to me?", "3384": "Yes. One value that's important to you and how is it related to what brought you here today.", "3385": "I would say equity is important to me and it is always... I have one son who is possibly on the spectrum and [inaudible]", "3386": "I'm sorry, Adria. If you can hear me? It looks like your phone cut out when it said, \"I have one son who is on the spectrum.\"", "3387": "Okay, it looks like we'll just pause, Adria, until your connection can come back and then we can pass it, the question to Ashley.", "3388": "So Ashley, the question was what is one value that's important to you and how is it related to what brought you here today?", "3389": "Definitely wellness in terms of individual peace of mind and wellness in the community. I know that there is, like Adria mentioned, a lot of inequity in terms of access to resources that help with wellness and I know that a lot of people are going through a lot of stress right now, on top of the existing disparities. So that is [inaudible]", "3390": "Ashley, if you wouldn't mind repeating that last sentence. You said, \"a lot of stress\" and then it seemed like your connection faded just a bit.", "3391": "Oh, okay. Yeah, a lot of stress. And that's just part of the reason I wanted to [inaudible] community can help.", "3392": "Thank you so much, Ashley. I'll pass it to Ebony.", "3393": "I'm sorry. What was the question?", "3394": "Sure. The question is, can you share with us a value that is important to you and how is it related to what brought you here today?", "3395": "Can I pass?", "3396": "Absolutely.", "3397": "I'll come back to you.", "3398": "Kristy? Would you share with us one value that's important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today?", "3399": "I would say one value is wellness. Just people living all their rights and stuff. I think it's good to talk about it, that's why I'm here.", "3400": "Thank you so much. Oh, it looks like Adria is coming right back.", "3401": "Hi, Adria. Thanks so much for logging back on.", "3402": "Yes, I lost signal so I was waiting for it to reconnect.", "3403": "So we lost you when you said equity is a value that's important to you because your son is on the spectrum.", "3404": "Yes, and I find that everybody [inaudible] what works for them and that it's taking that time and your empathetic time to go, hey you know what? Some people do need more help than others. Some people do need more time than others. And being able to establish that, I feel like it's just a big value to me, and I tend to feel that in my opinion that that lacks is the medical community.", "3405": "Thank you so much for sharing that, everyone.", "3406": "All right. So we're going to move right along here to our next question. And just bear with me if I'm pausing. My computer is freezing up just a bit.", "3407": "So the next thing we'd like to do is invite you to share a little bit about yourself. Because we'll be talking about health and well-being today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and well-being might look like and feel like to you. Next, think of a time, place, or story where you feel like you're at your best in terms of your health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at that time, and how did you feel? I'm going to pass it to Adria.", "3408": "I would say that the time health-wise I felt best, physically, is after my child, and I finally decided to take my health seriously and start walking around, moving around, using YouTube videos to exercise at home, which I didn't have [membership] at a gym or anything like that. So I was using YouTube to get a little healthier, and I used that time to really look at what I was eating, and I was using a weight loss app that actually helped me a lot with that because [inaudible 00:14:43]. You can have [inaudible]", "3409": "They gave me a plate to show me what my portions were supposed to look like, which was not at all what I was eating, and I felt that [inaudible] filed it [inaudible] few years later this guy showed me completely a different outlook, on what I eat, and how I move, and just taking that extra time to move around a little bit more, because it makes me feel healthier and better.", "3410": "Thank you so much, Adria. I'm going to pass it to Ashley.", "3411": "Okay, and right now we're just speaking to what well-being means to us, is that? Okay. So I think what well-being means to me is I think of a couple of things. I think of having a general baseline of calmness, or be able to bring myself back to a state of calmness, relatively easily. I think that kind of mental peace of mind is a huge piece of well-being. The ability to ground, when feeling like emotions, bring me to a place where I might do something not healthy or not useful. So for me, that mental peace of mind and grounding is very important, and also feeling like I can control my own peace of mind and grounding, like I can get to that place if I need to. That's a huge part of feeling grounded, centered. It's a huge part of well-being to me.", "3412": "And I think also having a sense of purpose. I think that a sense of purpose serves as a huge motivator to do things like exercise and eat well. It's hard, I think, to take care of your body and mind and show up for life if you feel like there's no reason to do so. So I think of that, too, in terms of well-being.", "3413": "Thank you so much, Ashley.", "3414": "Thank you.", "3415": "So next we have Ebony?", "3416": "I think of my well-being, like Ashley said, is it's hard to lose weight as you get older. The older you get, the harder it is to lose the weight. I think of my well-being as a beautiful thing. I think of it as I'm not angry. I learned to calm myself down, I learned to just be humble and be happy, and just don't let no one take my joy and my happiness. That's it, I have faith, so I'm in a happy spirit. And that's it.", "3417": "I just want to encourage folks, too, to if you have a time, specifically, when you felt your healthiest, to also if you feel comfortable sharing that. So was there a time when you felt like -", "3418": "I felt my healthiest when I was young, maybe when I was 14 or 15, when you're a teenager and you're like, okay, screw it, I'm going to just do what I want to do. I think [life says 00:18:35] the really time that I really had, okay, I just let it go, like that was it. I mean that's the only time. I think as I get older, I reach this like, okay...", "3419": "[crosstalk] What supports do you think around that time, when you were 14 or 15, did you have that made you really feel like yeah, I'm at my best right now?", "3420": "When I was like, 14... you're talking like right now? So honestly, I think I changed after I was maybe 19 or 20? And then I was just, you know what? I wasn't going to be this angry bitter person that was always just angry all the time, for no reason. So I was just, you know what, there are people out there that love me and adore me. So I was just, you know, I got to change for me, and that's exactly what I did. So I changed for me, and that's really basically it.", "3421": "Thank you so much for sharing that, Ebony.", "3422": "You're welcome.", "3423": "Kristy?", "3424": "Okay. I feel like when I'm at my healthiest is probably before quarantine, when I was able to go out, enjoy all that stuff, and to be able to express yourself outside. I really enjoy going outside. And I think, that's it.", "3425": "Is there anything specific about being able to enjoy yourself outside? Are there specific things in a structure, or specific activities that help you really enjoy outside?", "3426": "Well I like hanging out with friends and going out on walks. I feel like going outside is very important for your mental health and well-being, as well. And I feel like it really helps me, if I'm really stressed out or anything, to just take a walk and kind of be by yourself in that state.", "3427": "Thank you so much for sharing that, Kristy.", "3428": "So we're going to move right along to the next question. We want to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for the health and well-being in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of a community very broadly, and share about either your neighborhood community or your social community. When you're responding to questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you're thinking of when you share your story. I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope that this will be a time for some back and forth among you as you share your stories. I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they're made by others in the group, while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so.", "3429": "What in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your community's health and well-being? Share a story from your experience that'll help us understand this just a little bit better.", "3430": "I'm sorry, I'm sharing the questions now in the chat for people who have access to it, just because I know it's hard to remember, and if you don't want to go in order any more, that's totally fine because it's totally okay for people to pass and whatnot. Sorry, Adria. Questions in the chat, though.", "3431": "Adria, would you like to share?", "3432": "I have a few examples of things in my community that help. One, when we do the yoga, with Jen, and I've said this before with the yoga with Jen that we've been doing with the zoom calls, that I usually take yoga as way to just stretch out my body, and I find that when I do it as just a practice, I can focus more on a little bit of the introspection and finding my calm, and it really helps reduce my stress levels, and I really like that one, it's free, I can't even pretend. I like that it's free, I like that it's accessible, I like that it comes on, it's twice a week, so both times are a little bit more convenient for me, even if I miss one I can catch another, so I do appreciate that.", "3433": "Another thing I appreciate in my community is, I know it sounds a little bit vapid, but the internet. Because I found so many resources for people of color to do walks together, to do walks at home, and it's nice to feel like you're not alone, there's other people who feel those same struggles. It's other people in your community that you can reach out and say, hey let's go walk together, or hey, I got this [one] today, can you keep me accountable? And I find that to be amazing, just because it's like you always see one type of person doing these fitness classes, I think, like that. And when I see other people who look like me, look like my family, it's like, yeah, it's okay. These people are on the same track of trying to find their well-being and trying to find their balance. And I just find that really awesome.", "3434": "Thank you so much for sharing that. Does anyone else want to share what they feel like in the community is working for health and well-being? Or a story about how that experience has happened?", "3435": "I would say the garden.", "3436": "The Richmond Terrace Garden?", "3437": "I would say the garden. The garden is becoming beautiful, it helps when you are angry or upset. I love it. If it wasn't for Sarah Blas to come up with this amazing idea, I don't think we'd ever have a garden, so thank you. It's a beautiful garden. You come outside and you see beautiful plants growing, you see vegetables growing, you see everybody getting off the bus just to look at the garden and just like, wow, this is amazing. So I like it. I dig it, I like it, and continue to spread the love.", "3438": "Thanks, Ebony.", "3439": "You're welcome.", "3440": "Any other stories of what's working well in the community? Ashley, want to go?", "3441": "Yeah, so I can think of a couple of things. I think that coronavirus was probably the most contemporary issue, but I have to say for the most part, when I walk around my immediate neighborhood, between where I live and the ferry, it seems like when I see people out, that most people are taking this seriously. That I'm seeing people wearing masks, I'm not seeing groups crowded together. Quite a few of the businesses have the plastic barriers up, and I know that there's a lot of parts in this country right now where it's not like that at all. So when I'm walking around, I've felt really grateful to just observe, okay, at least in my immediate surroundings people appear, from the limited amount that I can see, to be taking this seriously. So that is reassuring because this is a public health issue.", "3442": "So I think there is an added sense of security when you're like, okay at least the people in my immediate neighborhood are looking out for each other, to a certain degree. And I think the looking out for each other goes well beyond that. I didn't grow up in Staten Island, I moved here about eight years ago. I moved here, I was living in Jersey before that and I moved here to be with my... a man I ended up marrying who is now almost my ex-husband once the courts re-open again. Thank you. I moved, and I didn't know anyone here.", "3443": "I know.", "3444": "I moved here for a relationship, and that relationship is now over, but I am choosing to stay because, and this is how it's relevant to the question, because I've found really amazing people on the North Shore of Staten Island.", "3445": "I've been involved with Move Forward Staten Island, Staten Island Women Who March, Peace Action, the Unitarian Church, there's a really... I'm really impressed by the interconnected web of people who really put a lot into the community, and have an understanding to learn more about issues that impact people, both globally, nationally, and locally. And I really found a lot of like-minded people here. It's been pleasantly surprising. And I think just being part of a community where you know there's like-minded people, you know that if you're in a bind, you have neighbors and community members to go to for help, and also that you can show up for them, too. Like for me, it's really that reciprocal nature with people in the community helps me feel whole and helps me have that passion that helps fuel me to take care of myself, too. Because it's constant validation like, yes, you're living for something, here is your purpose, you know?", "3446": "And there's just certain groups, I mean, Sarah, I walk by your garden all the time, because I live right by, and it's amazing. It's just so great, and to just walk around and just see all these examples of people showing up. And here's what I can do to make my community more beautiful. Even the murals painted on the doors of all the businesses, it's just really nice to be surrounded by it. And I think that certain organizations like Project Hospitality, Community Help Action of Staten Island, the way they show up, and the selflessness of a lot of these people, is pretty awesome. So I think having such dedicated people and organizations like that around really really do help the community, especially the most vulnerable. The way that Project Hospitality, in particular, has been showing up and Terry and all her staff is just incredible.", "3447": "So I think organizations like that just benefit the community so much. And it's so sad that organizations like that and other non-profits, it's always a shoestring budget. I wish that our society could see more of the impact they have in communities and prioritize those kind of groups more.", "3448": "I definitely agree with that. Especially the murals part, because as a teen, at the time it was the biggest mural in Brooklyn. That we did it with the Groundswell Project, and like you said, shoestring budget. We were getting, honestly the only reason we worked there was because SYEP paid us. So that was helpful. And it was amazing, it was amazing for us as a community to come together, because we all lived in Brooklyn. It was amazing to find out how murals were even made, and it really opened me up, because I was able to see so many more murals, and every time I'm like, I can tell the techniques. I can tell what the artist was thinking. And to see whenever I see a mural, I really feel like it tells a story of the community, and it's something lasting that tells the story of the community. And I feel like it leaves its earmark on the area. So I agree with that.", "3449": "That's wonderful. These are all really, really great examples of some of the things that are working to really promote wellness in the community. So thank you all for sharing that.", "3450": "I'd like to bring in the voice of someone who participated in a conversation in the Local Voices Network recently. I want you to imagine that this person is in the room with us, and listen very closely to their comments. I'll then invite you to share any responses and insights you gain from listening to these comments.", "3451": "The first thing for New York City to be healthy is for adequate healthy food to be available for everyone, regardless of where you live, for it to be affordable, that is the key. You can go shopping, like the young lady says, she goes to another supermarket outside of her neighborhood. She has to take a Uber, but is it always affordable to the people that live in public housing? Most of the time, it's not. Most people in public housing are on, well not most, but there are people in public housing that's on a fixed income. So if you're on a fixed income, you have to budget that money correctly for that whole entire week based on your family, or based on the month. Sometimes it's even based on day to day, which is even harder. That's a true hardship. So a healthy New York City would look like stores in our neighborhoods, across the city, that have healthy produce, fruits and vegetables, at an affordable price.", "3452": "That really resonates. That really resonates with me. Before, in St. George, before they opened that Key Food, and before they started that farmer's market in the parking lot by the St. George Theatre, it was a food desert here. I mean, there was no... I think the closest thing was maybe Western Beef, or Top Tomato, and that's a cab ride. You know? And I think a lot of places over in the North Shore, particularly as you head west on Richmond Terrace, I mean, it's... That really rings true up here, in terms of lack of accessibility to healthy affordable produce and things like that. And I think it definitely speaks to equity, the issue that Adria brought up. That's a perfect example of that. How are people supposed to nourish themselves if the options are not available to them?", "3453": "I would say sometimes it's sad that the only fresh fruit options our kids have are from school. And it's just, even when I say things to people now, they're just like, well what is that? There's not even a recognizability, because they don't see it often enough. And I want to say, sorry, is it Gerardi's? Okay, that was probably the closest place, because it's as you're walking, [Artist Terrace 00:35:20] museum? But even then, their prices, if there was more subsidiaries to help contribute to them, they would be able to lower prices down a little bit more. Be able to promote a little bit more, and do that option where they can accept SNAP and can accept WIC at their places, and just really be able to connect with the community. And make it so that healthy food is the norm, and it's not just something you see on TV, or you're mad that they gave you so many things on your WIC checks for, because you're like, nobody eats that many apples. And just I do understand that there's more there.", "3454": "I know I was on a community project thing, and they were doing clementines at grocery stores. And I thought that was amazing, because my kids love clementines, that's their number one fruits, vegetation, hi Maya. And it's crazy how much kids love clementines, and I know it sounds weird, but it's like the gateway fruit. So as soon as they get their clementines and they can peel them open themselves, it's just the excitement of that. And I thought giving it away for free was just such an awesome accessibility thing, because it encourages the stores to sell it as well as just giving it away for free, like the way they were doing it. So I thought that was awesome.", "3455": "I would like to invite anyone, that if you have any perspective on schools, because Adria, I know you mentioned fresh fruits through schools, but now that schools are handing out prepackaged foods, just adding that in there. What that looks like for people, where we were accessing fresh food a lot through schools, and maybe now we can't so much. And if that's not where we want to go, that's okay, but I'm just curious about people's perspective on that. [inaudible]", "3456": "Sure. I was just asking now that schools are handing out food, in different ways, because schools were closed, I've noticed that some of those prepackaged foods are not fresh. So you had mentioned that there were fresh foods coming from school, and that's a lot of ways that kids get fresh food, but now that doesn't really seem like an option, so I'm just curious as we're thinking about food deserts, when schools were contributing to mitigating some of that, and now they're kind of contributing to the Fritos and the cereal.", "3457": "Sometimes they give apples. That's the fresh food out of it. And that [inaudible] so much applesauce and fruit cup that a kid wants, and it is a hindrance. Now you have to go a little bit further to go get the stuff. Now the accessibility, because Gerardi's doesn't have, especially because of quarantine and all that, they don't have the same selection as before. So it is tough, and you have to work extra hard to get those things. And that's even more frustrating.", "3458": "Thank you.", "3459": "I'm sorry, I have to hop off and hop on another call, but thank you so much for hosting us.", "3460": "Thank you so much, Ashley, for joining us.", "3461": "Bye, everyone, nice meeting you, for those who I haven't met. Have a good day, everyone.", "3462": "So does anyone else have any more insights, reactions, or memories that came to mind when you were listening to the video that you'd like to share?", "3463": "I'll be a participant for two seconds, and just say that it's just extreme, I think some folks brought this up, a little bit, is how now with coronavirus and quarantine, we talk about selection looking different. But also if you live in a food desert, you have to take public transportation to get to food, and that's not safe. So people not feeling comfortable, or if you have your kids, should you pack up five kids and put masks on them, and maybe one of them's a baby and can't wear a mask, and go to a supermarket that has the fresh foods and things that you need. So it's further compounded by this limited mobility that we have, because we're in a pandemic.", "3464": "Absolutely, Jazmin, that's an excellent point. So what I invite everyone to want to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question, we're going to invite you to share, what is one thing that you've heard from today that you'll be taking away from this conversation, and that you would like other people to hear? Adria, would you mind starting?", "3465": "I swear, I'm really trying to listen, but all I heard was \"what is one thing,\" and then that was - [crosstalk]", "3466": "That's okay, I don't mind repeating myself at all. What is one takeaway from this conversation that you would want other people to hear?", "3467": "One key takeaway is that community aspect, where when the communities come together and I feel like that was probably the biggest thing. Where Ashley was saying how she is more likely to stay somewhere that is new to her because of the community. That the community made her feel grounded, and made her want to take care of herself.", "3468": "I feel like oftentimes, when we don't have a strong community, that's when everything kind of starts falling apart. So I really appreciate that she brought up having that community and having that network together, which she said was facilitated by her church and neighbors and things like that. I find that everyone has always liked a good block party in their neighborhood, so they can come together and you see everybody. And kind of be your brother's keeper from that, so that's something that I hope goes around everywhere. Especially in communities of color, I hope that we come together and we can uplift. Seeing people during quarantine trying to help out by having masks, handing out masks, giving things to everyone else around them, going to the store for the elderly, I find that really amazing, that everyone's taking that time to pull it together.", "3469": "Thanks so much, Adria. Are there any additional thoughts, about takeaways from this conversation that you want [inaudible] outside of this group?", "3470": "Keeping your joy, keeping your happiness. I know there's a pandemic going on, and everybody's going crazy, and everybody... well, not necessarily going crazy but panicking. And just keep your faith, keep your head up and have faith, and this will all be over. I can't wait for it to be over, so I can fly like a little delicious birdie. But I enjoy it, I just hope everybody keep their faith and just, I know there's a lot going on in this world. It's crazy things, and I hope everybody comes out and votes. Like Jazmin said, election is crazy because the pandemic is going on.", "3471": "But I hope we get a new president. Because I'm tired of his [toupee 00:43:39], he needs a new [lace stripe 00:43:40], we're just going to... He does, he needs a new [wastement 00:43:44]. I was totally just, we make it for him, but okay. But I enjoyed this conversation, it was a different conversation and like I say, I hope everybody just stay happy, keep your joy. Keep your spirits up, don't let anybody take your joy or your happiness away. Because the only person who can take that away from you is God. So that's it.", "3472": "Thank you so much.", "3473": "You're welcome.", "3474": "Are there any other additional comments?", "3475": "I would say that just communities, and how food can impact a community so much, like food deserts can impact a community so much, and how fresh fruits and vegetables is very important. I feel like that's very important and that we talked about it. And I agree with everyone else and the comments they made before.", "3476": "Thank you so much, Kristy. So as we wrap it up, I want to reference in the chat, it looks like there is a survey. Does everyone have access to that? If not, I can follow up with an email.", "3477": "Just delicious. Survey [inaudible]", "3478": "Jazmin, do you have any closing remarks? Would you like to take us home?", "3479": "Sure. I was also going to say, Sarah, I don't think we mentioned this at the beginning, or whether we fully advertised it, but everyone who participated will receive a $25 gift card, but we need to have your right email address. So fill out the form, I know you connected with Sarah to find your way here, so just make sure that that is accurate information so we can send you a e-gift card. And thank you all so much for coming. Sarah, thank you for facilitating. Everyone with children, we made it through this conversation so, yay.", "3480": "Yeah [interruption]", "3481": "Thank you all for that. And we will be having another conversation next week at 7:00 PM, so folks have other thoughts or things that they want to share, please let us know. Also, Sarah, I know we talked about setting up some additional resources, so through the work that we do at SIPCW, between CWI, which is Child Wellness Initiative, and the two projects that Sarah and I work on, we have a lot of information about food access, food justice, and mental health and substance use resources, especially during coronavirus. So we'll make sure that we send all that stuff to everyone who has their, again, accurate email address, and then we'll, because we don't want to leave you hanging after we have this conversation. That's all I have to say. Sarah, do you have anything else?", "3482": "No, that's it. We're going to follow up with your gift cards, we're going to follow up with some resources, and thank you so much for sharing your personal stories and lived experiences that we can all work together to make a better community for all of us. And of course a huge thanks to the Local Voices Network for pulling us in as a partner and providing this space for conversation.", "3483": "Cool. Okay. So here it goes, it says welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, in collaboration with the New York City Trans Oral History Project. Thanks for coming. My name is Aviva [redacted] and this is Michelle [redacted].", "3484": "Hello everyone. I'm Michelle [redacted].", "3485": "As you said, we're part of the New York Trans Oral History Project and we're just going to be trading off as facilitators of this, and we're just really blessed to have you. Now that we started recording, let's see, it says the purposes of our conversation is to just create a space for us to listen and learn about each other, to connect across groups and to build up relationships with each other and to create this listening channel that hopefully we'll lift up voices and the needs of communities to candidates and local policy makers and members of the media. The Local Voices Network wants to foster sharing our stories.", "3486": "So in this conversation, you're invited to share stories about your experiences with health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information, unless you want to and then this is the consent thing. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually it'll make the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant of this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico the operator of Local Voices Network to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversation in community and the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "3487": "This is a public conversation and the portions of it may appear in the local newspaper or websites, or be broadcasted in local radio stations or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please share what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, just say I agree and we'll just go around and say, I agree, and then we can keep moving. I'm just going to write an order really quick. Can you just say, I agree, if you agree.", "3488": "I agree.", "3489": "I agree.", "3490": "I agree.", "3491": "I agree.", "3492": "I agree as well.", "3493": "And I agree. So this is an open format. We're going to ask one question as a circle format and then we'll just open it up and we'd really love you guys to talk to each other, to ask questions of one another and to just build off that, it doesn't have to be so formal. We don't have to each share equal time around each question. And if you're not interested in talking about a question, you don't have to answer it. So it's pretty loose. But to start, we just want to have a quick round of introductions.", "3494": "So if you could just share your name and your pronouns and where you are right now and maybe a value that you bring to your work or something that really uplifts the work that you do, that would be really great. And we'll start with Michelle and then me, and then we'll go around.", "3495": "Hello everyone. I'm Michelle. I use she in her pronouns and I'm currently in Brooklyn. A really core value of mine is solidarity being really interested in how people can listen, connect with each other, support each other in struggles and together be a part of processes of transformation and liberation. Did I miss anything Aviva?", "3496": "No. Great. That was perfect.", "3497": "Thanks.", "3498": "I'm Aviva, I use they/them pronouns. I am in the North Bay occupied land that is New Jersey right now. And I'm going to just say interdependence, since it takes all of us to keep it moving and to keep working together to make other things outside of the grander narratives happen and that's a really broad thing, but anyway you guys can just go in the order that I typed out already.", "3499": "I think you're muted Cayenne.", "3500": "I am. I'm sorry. I'm Cayenne pronoun mom. I'm the founder with Equity. Equity would be what we're looking for.", "3501": "I am Rhea. I'll go with dad, to Cayenne's mom. I'm currently in Toronto and I think a concern for retaliation is the thing that I always bring to my work and what that's going to look like for my people, because it's not my life on the line as a lawyer. It's theirs.", "3502": "Hi everyone. My name is Maliah. I use she in my pronouns and I think, Oh, I'm in Harlem, at the moment Harlem right now. And I would say the value I bring to my work is trust. I'm the supervisor at Harlem Lord and I think the greatest lesson I've learned with my staff that I supervise is to build trust and respect.", "3503": "Okay, hi, I'm Wido. I use they pronouns and I'm in Brooklyn and I'd have to agree that trust is a big tenant in what I'm thinking about and trying to build and everything that I do take in people's experiences seriously and deconstructing, whatever it is that I think I might know. There isn't really a word for that but I guess, deconstruction is something that I like to bring to the table when I can.", "3504": "One of the things that we skipped over earlier were around the goals, one element that I really want to encourage people to do is when answering questions, you're here because you do extraordinary work and you have a lot of insight. And to really try to connect the answers you're giving to stories, to concrete experiences, to things that you've really seen and observed that can really help out in making a conversation like this really accessible and transformative for people.", "3505": "So when possible in answering questions, if there are particular stories that occur to you, that help make sense of how you arrived at that position or how you learned about it, you're encouraged to share those. So we're going to abandon the circle format and move into asking questions that you are encouraged to answer as you were inspired to. Of course, you are very welcome to skip any questions that you don't want to answer. And we also really encourage people to respond to each other, that just having a succession of unrelated answers, is a lot less interesting than if we can figure out how to have a conversation and actually hear each other and respond to each other and maybe argue a little bit is very welcome.", "3506": "So just to start off, the broad framework of this conversation is what health means to us and what it takes to be healthy and how health works and how that's defined for you and your community. And we thought a really concrete way in would be to talk a little bit about how our communities, overlapping communities or communities that you're connected to have been impacted by COVID-19 and some of how you've seen that play out for people that you care about. Anyone is welcome to answer,", "3507": "I guess I'll start. COVID-19 really, really impacted my personal life. I was not connected to a lot of community members that have passed away in the beginning, but when Lorraina Balhas passed away, I had to be connected and getting on the phone with my mortician. Once I'd seen those trucks that was my immediate fear, Oh my God, we have to get her. And without doubt, this man has never failed me in over 20 years of taking care of community members for me. He did not fail during COVID. And it was before the federal, whatever was giving people permission to actually get the bodies.", "3508": "There was no format or formula to how the bodies were going to be handled. Manny, my mortician actually got the clearance within 24 hours and picked her up. I think they put a 48 hour pause on getting a body or they'd be put in the morgue. It was really disgusting. I was already traumatized just the thought of how we don't have equity. So what COVID would look like for us in New York City, just broke my heart. As I started to go to Facebook and all these social media platforms, I've seen what looked like us being taken out.", "3509": "My friends were dying like this. Well, sweetie I went through their journey AIDS epidemic. I'm not going to do it, then I was younger and I didn't have the body nor the backing to fight for folk. Now that I do, I invested everything into COVID and taking care of us, at a time where and we're still going to go to those people who have let down their guard a little. It's something I will never forget in my lifetime. It's something I never thought I would see and this was no joke. I actually dreamed about it a couple of months. So I said, what if there was like, and I dreamed in a different way. I had a dream that there was this giant tsunami that took over New York and two or three months later, we have an actual pandemic.", "3510": "Yeah. It's doing work primarily with people in prisons of state, not Rikers, but in prison where there has been no bail arguments, no clemency, no mass release and even, as an abolitionist, as someone who is cynical about the law, who doesn't think that no lawyers saved anyone ever. I was shocked and horrified at the extent to which there was no way out. And just the fact that Cayenne has a personal mortician, it's a level of seriousness that I now feel the orientation that you're talking about towards HIV and AIDS.", "3511": "They'll like mass death of your people. It's something that we're seeing now with prisons in this way but there's no way to get the body. There's no way to have a visit. There's no way to get on the phone. There's no way to get an email. My client Darlene, who'd survived, just every kind of violence and trauma that you can have in a lifetime, who somehow still manages to be a joyful uplifting leader and mom inside got COVID. I think the last week of April and almost instantly was in the hospital and you think like, Oh, you're out of prison into a private hospital, maybe that's an improvement, then there's no mail.", "3512": "There's no phone, there's no face. Actually, guards wouldn't let anyone face time with her not until her last breath, would they let her sister's face time with her, let alone the lawyers and the other folks inside who cared about her just disappeared. It's happening over and over again, and most of us don't even have the slightest clue what's going on in these prisons. We snatch these tiny bits of information from email and from the phones, but everything is monitored. Everybody's concerned about retaliation and there's no way out. But COVID finds its way in and out.", "3513": "And so what that means for caring for each other has been, I don't know that there are any answers or lessons for me other than there's this fierce desperation they're slow, but they can't. Can only find its way in these tiny, tiny, tiny moments and just this 45,000 prison population that we have just all watched be inside for months and no matter how much we scream about it, nothing seems to change.", "3514": "You know I did get a girl out of prison. I love the board events. I loved school period. This young woman was in college upstate New York, doing NYU classes and her professor got me to get her out and damn right, I did. She was the one trans woman in this whole prison that they put it on male facility. You damn right, I got her ass out. And we have her in Manhattan doing well.", "3515": "Cayenne, you got to tell me that story sometime. If not here you going to tell me how you did it. I believe you, because you're basically magic at this point, but does anyone else have any other thoughts around the first question or we can keep it moving, unless Rhea or Wido has anything to add. Okay, Maliah.", "3516": "I'm a social worker and the work I do is focused on not only mental health, but with youth and adolescents. So I work in the health program or health outreach to teens program. And really what my team has been seeing are young people just really needing someone to check in with, having that security that they will be taken care of and if they have any needs in regards to their hormones and any other medications that they have. And something for me personally, I have been battling with depression for a very long time and some anxiety. And I think in early COVID when everyone was responsing in a panic and a lot of fear and underlying traumas that folks have had in our past, we're coming to the surface.", "3517": "And we're also presenting themselves in different ways or in ways that may have been unmanageable. And for me personally, I tried to stick it out as much as I see my therapist weekly. I also had been thinking about starting antidepressants for a while. And I eventually came to a place where I was like, \u201cOkay, I don't think therapy is working for me and I think now is the time to try and get started on antidepressants.\u201d So, that was a big step for me and it wasn't easy. It was definitely a huge adjustment. I'm also a person living with HIV.", "3518": "And so as much as I have experienced taking medication on a daily basis, it just reminded me of when I first started taking HIV medications, my body adjusting to a new medication, I had a lot of side effects, a lot of nausea, headaches and thankfully I am doing a lot better now, but it was definitely a few weeks of adjusting to that. And I think another thing I've noticed a lot with a lot of my trans sisters is just checking in on one another face timing. We were pretty consistent early on and I think as time, as people started to get more comfortable and find their grounding, we still check in on each other, but it's not as often. And for me, the biggest thing right now is just wanting to be with family, but all my family lives in California.", "3519": "I think that's been another stressor for me just wanting to be around them. Summertime, we have a lot of birthdays in my family and they've been getting together and gathering and I've just been feeling really lonely and left out in that. So I think those are the ways that I've been impacted personally and the ways that I've seen in my community impacted as well.", "3520": "Thank you, Maliah.", "3521": "What of?", "3522": "Right into the summer.", "3523": "I'm going to tell you thank you for being transparent Maliah, just talking about depression and anxiety. I think mine's at one hundred, it's been a couple of times. I think this time you really earned it. it's hard and what you just did was open up to join the people talking about some real shit, having nobody, being depressed, being in this position of helping and being vulnerable because we need help too. Thank you.", "3524": "I wanted to add to the topic of the anxiety and depression and suicidality and the community is that I feel close to that I'm in. In my own experience, I think there's been at least a dozen overdoses, relapses, suicides, and my immediate or peripheral community maybe a lot of people noticing that as well. More than the people I know, and family members of people that I know that have died of COVID I feel the fragility that people are experiencing from the economic crisis, only ever having careers and criminality as sex workers on the street, not people that make that choice from a place of empowerment.", "3525": "A lot of people that have been living without the opportunity, it's even to really pay taxes and benefit from some of these benefits that a lot of people are receiving like unemployment, some undocumented friends. And what I have noticed is such a great deal of resilience and power, even in the choices that some of those peers have made to leave this place. The agency to the tap out, I feel it takes a lot of bravery. I also think it takes a lot of bravery to stay. I'm looking to everyone with so much on respect for whatever choices that we're making right now and finding it so imperative to find ways to connect, if that's what people are looking for, to listen to each other.", "3526": "Having a lot of grief about a dear friend that had been missing for weeks and her body was found like a, a suicide. I feel so compelled to reach out. I've never felt so driven to actually create a deeper sense of mutual aid in my communities. I feel like people are having to make so many different kinds of choices to live their diary now. And I'm really in awe at the rapid acceleration of all of our consciousness and who is bending together. Who's living together, who's sharing money, who's still working on the streets. Who's not had the privilege to quarantine this whole time and is continuing to just give everything that they have fearlessly.", "3527": "Because to some extent the choices that I feel a lot of marginalized people have to make are more about your community and your people on your ability to survive in a different way than what the recommended survival status of staying in, collecting this, cooking for yourself not everyone has that option. Survival looks all different ways. So I've just been observing the radical decisions that people are making to survive in their autonomy and in their communities. And also I'm feeling a lot of humility and grief and also respect for the friends that have decided to cross over, that died alone. That don't have, it's really hard not to gather around some of this grief to have a grieving ritual.", "3528": "I feel just an opening in my heart and a desire to connect with anyone that has wanting an ear or to share the weight of all of this and just the differentiation of experience. I don't feel I can judge anyone in it or myself right now, because we're watching such big tectonic shifts and in some ways it's horrifying. Hopefully in some of the ways that it's turning some of the ways that I'm observing, at least those of us that have maybe been on the fringe are starting to trust ourselves and each other more, finding ways to be here or not. And I know that's kind of vague, but those are just some of my thoughts for now.", "3529": "Thank you, everyone people's answers really wove together your community work and your personal suffering and concrete stories in such a powerful way. I've been typing in the chat a little bit, it's one thing that's come out in an emergent stories about strategies of how we've taken care of each other of how people in your community have taking care of each other and strategies of survival, Wido mentioned mutual aid, Cayenne talked about fighting for folks. Three of you mentioned people checking in on each other a lot more often.", "3530": "In the script, there are a bunch of questions about what do we do to make communities safer. And I'd like to hear more about what you've seen in your own life and in the lives of people around you of strategies of survival, of taking care of each other.", "3531": "If we're talking in the past and to present, and back in the day, organizing for trans women came under such scrutiny when most of the agencies and places we could go we were not allowed to. Well, we were allowed there as guests, special guest gay men's health crisis, gay men's health crisis, many gays and lesbians of New York. There was no T what felt ever. So when a trans woman was trying to go and get services and get help for community, you would literally hear social workers and doctors and public assistance or fraud as is transvestite and transactional, anything that sounded dehumanizing that was the obstacle we was up against.", "3532": "And now we progress to getting a word transgender. Wow, we're supposed to be happy about this, but what we have done as a community is unified, and it may be separated at times like the Latino community of New York, they want to help their community. Wonderful. The Caribbean community wants to help their community of trans women. Wonderful. But as a United front, we need to be doing this together and we need to include our trans brothers. They get left out of all these conversations. They're not included because we don't talk about this enough. When we're talking about just trans women, we need to be talking about trans people all together, because we're all United. And we have done some amazing stuff.", "3533": "There's several trans founders in New York City, all over the world founders, that's unreal and amazing. The fact that we're not just working as an aide in a joint, we're actually owning it. We're supervisors. We're directors speaks to the tone, how we can change the game, because we have people listening to what needs to help our community. So we've definitely progressed to marches that look like us, black trans march, black trans lives matter. This is amazing. We need to see more of this, this kind of organizing, this kind of community support, where we can show the younger generation that we're not what society thinks we are. We are so much more.", "3534": "One thing that really sticks with me that I was talking about is that ideally what would come out of this is some breaking down of borders and some of these ideas of who's deserving and who's not, and who is worth it, and who's not. That's one core lesson that I take away from people who have articulated concepts of mutual aid for centuries, and especially in the abolitionists communities is that what's interesting in our prisons is that lawyers will be the first ones to say, you're a client I want to take because you deserve a lawyer.", "3535": "You're a client I don't want to take because you don't. In the community that I'm in, the abolitionist community that I'm in has just completely disappeared by virtue of COVID, by virtue of people being confined. There's an instinctual sense that every person who reaches out for help and every person who's making contact should be advocated for in some way. It's not perfect. I'm not claiming that all lawyers are heroes here. I'm just saying one beautiful thing, I think that has come through the urgency of COVID and from everyone hearing the word mutual aid, and some people at least thinking deeply about what that means is an abolition of the idea that only some people deserve.", "3536": "When we were fundraising for people's commissary funds, it was like, literally anybody who sends a cash app request is getting 100 bucks. It doesn't matter where the request comes from. It doesn't matter who you are. Doesn't matter whether you say for whom it is you're getting the money. It's a beautiful thing to watch people just not doubt each other at all and trust each other, even on technology where there's so much anonymity. And so that's something that keeps me going a lot, because that constant sense that only some people deserve, it's killing us all. So it's just nice to see that atrophy a little bit, because that impulse needs to go.", "3537": "Thank you, Rhea. That's an amazing point. Thank you. Does anyone else have anything to add to this question, Oh yeah, and Rhea?", "3538": "I think early on when COVID first started, there were a lot of videos being posted on social media around anti-asian and I thought, and I know my neighbor, one way we've been able to regularly check in on each other and feel safe when going to the grocery store together is just we'll have our masks and we walk to the grocery store, we do our grocery shopping together, and then we walk each other home. And that for me has been really helpful. I know when I go to the grocery store alone, as a trans person walking down the street, I'm always afraid of being harassed.", "3539": "And I think with everything that is going on with COVID, I think my agoraphobia was bad enough before, and then was just through the roof during COVID and still is sometimes. I think I've reached a place of stability where I can go for a walk just around my block and feel safe. But I think it's in terms of safety, I've been staying at home and I am lucky that I have been able to work from home. And thankfully I haven't had to leave my house too often. And then for the times when I don't have the energy to go grocery shopping, I've been ordering groceries and I've also had friends who have been super generous and who have offered to go get groceries for me. And so I think really those going along with those mutual aid efforts, it's been really beautiful to see people really just caring after one another.", "3540": "Thank you. Wido, do you have anything to add about mutual aid or projects or ways that you've been invested or involved with people in your community?", "3541": "I think that I've only recently started thinking about lifting the concept out of the immediate needs of the people that I just know really personally, into a bigger sphere because the call feels so extreme and it's almost like activating a principle that's just been so intrinsic in the way that my peers and I have been functioning forever. And it feels really instinctive to me in the trans community that this is just what our lives are about and I've always been about because if the medical industry is not taking you seriously. If your family is not taking you seriously, if the professional world isn't taking you seriously I'm glad that I have a lot of privilege in those domains.", "3542": "How I pass and what my gender is, but I just feel this is such an old instinct for any of us, what we have is kind of for each other. And I feel that vibration really strong in my trans community is in a way that's starting to become such a visible model for other people to look to. So I'm thinking a lot about how to act to activate that on a larger scale. I feel actually recently have come into some conflict with a group that I've been trying to organize with and find it really interesting when people organizing, I don't want to make assumptions about what their platforms are, but there's a lot of people that I think are organizing from a different place of like, Oh, I have a lot of Cis white privilege and a lot of access to space.", "3543": "So I should do this because it's the right thing to do, as opposed to coming from a place with a race or class experience, that's really driving the passion in a different way. That vulnerability is not always compatible and I find the power dynamics in that organization, something that's always been really daunting for me. So it's like, I want to say something or contribute, or I feel I want to be in a group, but I feel a lot of times I've tried to intersect with some more like organized, radical organizers and I just can't believe that the hierarchy is so fucking, it just feels really fucking ignorant and disrespectful. And yet here I am having this judgment about other people.", "3544": "So I don't think this is the point I was trying to make, but I do wonder what people feel about others, they seem to have different platforms, working with wider scopes for maybe people in the community that are wanting to activate the adversity that you meet when you're dealing with organizers with a lot of privilege and a lot of academic language and a lot of things that can be intimidating or off-putting when your lived experience. I feel really passionate. There's a lot I'd like to give, but sometimes I feel I'm hitting a wall for lack of a better phrase, PC academic bullshit. Maybe that's a topic I'd like to open up if anyone has any-", "3545": "Weird.", "3546": "\u2026 things to say about that.", "3547": "I guess I'm brutally abusive to my audience. Often, I am transparent on all levels and I talked to academia, I use my web white allies and all of them unite. I want them and I pull them in. I want them to know the real raw shit about what our lives are. And a lot of the mutual aid, I'm one that stayed out of the game and done glitz by myself because I didn't want to be bothered with a whole bunch of people. I don't like the organizing. And I say this a million times, we got some shitty ass organizers here in this state and all over the world.", "3548": "I think the fact that I'm transparent gets to help because I don't have time to waffle or try to work around their words and all of that. So when they go above, I tell them to break this shit down. I need to understand you and you need to understand me. And that's a way of getting your audience and getting, especially with the mutual AIDS in the beginning. I didn't think I would get a dime because I've been such a bitch and that's only to protect myself. You got to protect yourself first, you can't help somebody.", "3549": "You can't help someone if you're the same person that needs that help. So one, I have to step up and say, \"Okay, we all need help.\" I had identified that I'm one of these people doing the work, but I also had that identify with the fact that you're there for a reason and I'm going to make you work. The first thing I did was went to the sex worker mutual aid, and I told them, \"Here, I need help. I've sent out so much money. I needed a different way of doing this.\" And swap Brooklyn gave like scholarships for full weeks of $200 to 20 girls that I pick.", "3550": "That's sustainable for to get $200 every Monday, let me know that they didn't have to worry about those 20 girls. Then I went to Lester Strada because they said they were a mutual aid, \"Well, we're going to spend up all the mutual aid you got.\" Then I went to [redacted] and I'm going to be very specific about how they were pimping me for $10,000. $10,000. I got 20, 50,000. For $10,000. They not only wanted me to give up sex workers' information, phone numbers, where they are staying. These people I've gotten out of jail. So I had to speak a different language.", "3551": "I had to give it to my coordinator and have them write woman a letter back explaining how all of that is a conflict of interest for our community, but for a grant. And I had to ask myself, \"Well, why would they need information like that?\" As long as I live as a sex worker, and this was 40 something years, I've never given someone government name or their phone number. We don't do that. But some of these mutual aids actually wanted content. Well, then not a mutual aid, sweetie. You're trying to get some more funding.", "3552": "So, I get what you're saying, but any time you fall into a hole and you need a bitch to come where you are, I'm coming right over there to talk shit to get you some money, because that's what you need. It's the organizer with the heart that gets the work done. And all these corporate big donors and all of this, if they're real people, they'll hear you no matter what level you are on. Bust them doors and windows open. I got your back. You call me and say, \"Kayan, I need you.\" I'm coming.", "3553": "Thank you.", "3554": "Obviously, Cayenne just set a bunch of really important things. I'm not denying that, but can you give any examples of what you're dealing with? I instantly credit the experience of you saying, \"Look, when you are living on the edge of society, you are collective, you are surviving together.\" None of that I question, I'm just curious whether there's like any specific instance that you want to tell the story of that we can \u2026 because I feel like the thing you're describing is so pervasive, right?", "3555": "The thing you're describing is like power and power is recreating itself. As people run into the tent of cortical radical organizing and mutual aid and abolition. And I feel like the abolition screen is really struggling right now with like, \"Why are all these people complicating the narrative about what defunding mean?\" Defunding means defunding. It doesn't mean anything, right? So, as power replicates itself in all these ways, I'm just curious whether there's something that we can bite off in this to actually be useful to you or whether it's just like power and what do we do?", "3556": "I think that's a great question. I'm in the middle of a dialogue and I'd like to give some of these people the benefit of the doubt, but feel like I've been basically approached for some of the communication tactics that I have with some of the people that have showed up for the mutual aid in this organization. I'm a really direct person. There's really no one on earth that I don't talk to from the same place. If I feel like something's fucked up, I'm going to say it. I might be an antagonistic individual. I don't feel like I want to be, but it's really hard for me to be quiet.", "3557": "So I'm just dealing with a situation where it's like the power dynamics of a certain kind of PC-ness that want my voice out of the way. Like using some like vocabulary to make it impossible for me to be a voice for certain things that I believe in. I think I don't want to like reveal too many details because maybe some of us are community members. But maybe the thing that I'm addressing is just like the power dynamic in these situations that can get in the way of the most direct access to channels and communication, and harm reduction and the styles that certain people have like myself in communicating that are really not going to \u2026 I'm just like, \"Yo, this is pissing me off.\"", "3558": "Like, \"Hey, can we talk about this?\" Like, \"What do you need?\" \"I need this.\" I'm not going to talk to like a rich art kid differently than I am a peer or someone I meet on the street that may or may not have mental illness. I have mental illness. I don't assume things about people. And I think sometimes in approaching some organizations that seem to have people that have different education and class statuses, but my style of communicating as almost being policed out of the work. And I find myself to be just can be really effective in communicating with a lot of different kinds of people. I'm being really vague.", "3559": "But I think it's just the power dynamics of the elite and wanting to organize from a different place with different people that \u2026 and I just have this longing and there's something that I want to do. And I feel it's like a personality block because I don't want to follow rules, but I don't think that like anarchy is really about that. I feel like a new idea is going to be antagonistic to a status quo. Sometimes I just wonder how to be impactful and to own something you believe in-wall. You also have to follow the rules to get something from point A to point B. I don't know if I'm making sense, but I'm going to cut myself off now.", "3560": "Nope. I think you're making a lot of sense. Like I was educated in very elite spaces. I feel very, I think, familiar with some of the things that you're talking about. Right now, I just assume that the only thing the elite people can offer you and your community, at least just from the little you've described is money. All you can do is take their money and then run with it. And there's a part of me that's like, \"Do you actually have to organize with people who have that dynamic or is there a way to get their money and not have to deal with them?\"", "3561": "And I'm curious what Cayenne would say about it, just having raised like $2 million overnight. I think from a lot of elite ass people who probably don't know a black trans woman, but it will all of a sudden want to give their money. That's my assumption. I could be totally wrong about that.", "3562": "So, that dynamic is 100. This is why I told you, you be your authentic self. If somebody in that room is trying this sweetie is just that. Them trying it and you, light, in a very polite way, you light their asses up. So the directness cuts the middleman. You tell them right off the bat, \"Listen, we're not going to have a conversation I don't understand. These are the things I need. I'm a marginalized community member that needs your help. I don't need you to tell me how to talk. I need you to give me the help. Sweetie, I've never been in this predicament or position I'm in, but the past COVID practically drove me crazy.", "3563": "I've also been in the house for three months. Sunday was the first time I've been out in three months to a function or seeing community.\" That's speech, one, came from my heart. I don't write speeches, I talk from the ass and it comes up out of my mouth. And I'm direct. That's speech with everything I've felt in my soul and my spirit, from my toes to my hands. It literally shook me. I didn't even remember what the hell I said, but when I got home, I'd seen the speech and I cried. And then it started to happen. And then one day, we had a million dollars and by the next day, a march.", "3564": "So you are powerful. You are the next generation of who's going to kick this shit all the way in. Because somebody like me told you, \"It's okay for you to do it the way you want to do it.\" Now, their job is to pony up, pay up and give up.", "3565": "Thank you so much. That's so beautiful. I was there at the march and I'm just like, it was a blessing. Thank you. We're just going to pivot a bit just to keep the conversation in this LVN in the Local Voices Order. And I just wanted to ask, because we're living in this moment of two profound crises, the epidemic, and then the epidemic of police violence, especially anti-black violence. We wanted to know how you find yourself in your community, now? How has it impacted your health and wellbeing and your communities? And if there's anything you want to share around this other epidemic that is also happening with us right now.", "3566": "As a black person, as a black trans person, I fear for all of us. I fear, especially for the trans community. The police have no one else to target all the anger or all of it gets shifted to my community. Then society shifts everything to our community, but clearly what the police have done to us in death and in life have been horrific. And we have been the ones that nobody fights for. They had a huge march and I've watched it all over TV, for George Floyd. God bless them. I'm glad they did.", "3567": "But didn't have one of those huge marches for black trans woman until Sunday. Throughout the COVID experience, sex workers were being murdered left and right. The majority of them trans women, but you didn't see a march for them. You didn't hear the stories. All over Instagram, Facebook, you seen girls being attacked, physically attacked during the marches. And the police thing at that moment, horrible. We seen a black young girl go to the store to buy tampons and get arrested because she violated curfew. This is policing going wrong.", "3568": "So, I fear for us coming up out of this. I feel for us going to grocery stores. I feel if I was going to check cashing places, because when society comes out on the other end of this, we're going to be some pretty fucked up people if we don't do something now about the police. What do you call that? Not the police board. What do you call a thing the police have to answer to?", "3569": "Internal Ferris?", "3570": "The union. The union. We need to be attacking them first because the police have been able to keep jobs and keep desk position and go back to street beats. If we attack that union, then we're attacking them because they won't have the backing, they've had to come back each time. We need a civilian response team that investigate every damn cop out here. We need guns away from police. I could go on and on. I've seen a video throughout COVID where a cop took a boy in the back of a building and fucked him.", "3571": "So this is how bad policing is. Did that cop know he was being recorded? Not at all. But this is some of the stuff that happened during a pandemic.", "3572": "Yeah. Okay. Short of abolishing the police, which I'm wholeheartedly for, what does safety look like for those people going to the store to buy tampons, or going to buy grocery? Do we need physical accompanying? I was moved by the crowds in Brooklyn, but I'm like, \"Can all you just like buddy up and keep people safe?\" I want to believe in my head that if there was a single white or cis person with every black trans girl going to the grocery, that this wouldn't happen. But maybe I'm just crazy and it still would.", "3573": "I'm all for having some servants should now. Listen, I'm going to be 100 here. I only rented this apartment because my lawyer came with me. If I didn't bring my lawyer to rent this house that I'm renting, I would have never got it. Ever, ever, ever.", "3574": "So Cayenne solution's more lawyers, right? I just want you to get you on the record saying-", "3575": "No, the solution was a white woman who happens to be a lawyer who was my friend, but they didn't know she was a lawyer. All they knew she was a white woman. That's how I actually got to rent this place. Otherwise, I would now be in a shelter and I don't know about you all, but as a black trans woman, if I go into a shelter, I'm going to be on drugs. In a matter of a week, I won't even give it a hot week because of the elements. And you might have a point there. Maybe we should be asking our allies to assist us in all our visits and our doctor's visits, where we got to go. This is how white people can show up and show up, and shut up, outside of giving money. I like money.", "3576": "Do folks have more to say about how you've seen police violence playing out lives of people you care about?", "3577": "So, I went to the protest at Stonewall and I was terrified, but I was also really angry. And I think I just wanted to be surrounded by community at the time. And it felt good that there was a protest centering Tony McDade and Nina Pop. And it also brought me together with some of my coworkers who hadn't seen each other in a really long time. And we met up and I think it brought me to learn more about some of their experiences that they've had in the past. And one of them had shared with me how he was just trying to defend someone in Washington Square Park from being arrested by, not even a police officer, but one of the park rangers.", "3578": "And the police were called and he ended up being \u2026 this is a trans person of color. He ended up being beaten and arrested. And so he was just sharing with me how having that experience in the past really brought him \u2026 it really triggered a lot of the police violence that is happening today. But also like we know that this is nothing new, that this has been happening for a very long time. And now, people are actually just being better at recording it. And I've been to many protests before Black Lives Matter protests. And I will say that I hadn't been as afraid as I was, because of the videos that I was seeing on Twitter and social media of the police just being completely ruthless.", "3579": "Not giving a damn about \u2026 someone wouldn't even have to be doing anything wrong and then they would just be pushed to the ground. Or cops pulling people's masks out their face and pepper spraying them in the face. So it's just going to that protest, I was trying to mentally prepare myself for that. I was like, \"I'm going to this protest not just to express my anger, but I'm going to go there to also try and protect the people that I love, who deserve to be protected.\" And also hope for that if anything were to happen to me, people would show up for me and try to protect me.", "3580": "But I also was like Stonewall was a riot and it was important for me to show up and remember that and honor the legacy of our ancestors. And I think one thing right now, for me, is just trying to make myself available to all of my black community members and be checking in on them more frequently. And doing that emotional labor. I know that that's what I'm good at and that's what I can provide. And then also, sharing fundraisers left and right. I have people in my network and people in my communities who have money and power and so I'm doing everything that I can to share fundraisers and redistribute that wealth because it's very needed right now.", "3581": "But it is also a lot going on. And I think a lot of people are sometimes forgetting that COVID is still happening. And so, yeah, I think there's still a lot of the same fear that I had when COVID first began. But now it's just multiplied and right now I'm just trying to do my best to take care of myself and the people that I love.", "3582": "Great. Thank you. Our next question is about rupture, about the possibility or moments of transformation. So Wido, you mentioned this acceleration of consciousness that we've seen lately. And I think a lot of people both have been politically radicalized in this moment, a lot of centrist liberals beginning to think about what police are for, or the need for healthcare. And then, other people beginning to think about much deeper and bigger transformations in a way that they seem possible, maybe, for some that they haven't before.", "3583": "And I'm wondering if anyone could talk a little bit about new ways of thinking or being that you've seen emerge in this time. Senses of transformation or glimpses of how society could be really different than it is.", "3584": "I can just say I've never seen more people like in mainstream media and everyday language discussing that capitalism is our biggest issue and that it's not okay or it's not enough to just be in solidarity and to be an ally, but to really push that analysis further into anti-racism and anti-oppression. So it's good to see that. And also, I think I'm, going back to the discussion that we were having earlier, I'm aware that not all of those concepts and languages are accessible to everyone. But I think I am seeing a change. And it's also amazing to see that these protests are actually creating change.", "3585": "I remember seeing that the LAPD budget was cut early on in the protest and also curfews, after they were put in place, because people protested, I remember hearing Oakland. Their curfew was lifted after the next day or two. And so it's like things are changing, but it is after \u2026 what more do we have to do to continue this trend of change? But I'm trying to be hopeful. And also, sometimes I'm just really afraid of the next election. And just it's like there's a lot of good and bad happening right now with the Supreme Court like the protection on job employment discrimination.", "3586": "And I think it was today about the Supreme Court fighting DACA. So, there are a lot of things happening and I feel like it's been a long time coming. And also, it's happening at this point because of the decades of organizing work that has been done. So it's like I also honor and acknowledge that the work that's being done now has been paved for us by the people who have been doing the work for a very long time.", "3587": "Thank you, Maliah. Wido, do you have something to add or did you raise your hand before?", "3588": "Yeah, I think that a lot of what I was thinking was just covered. So I want to just bow to that. And also, it's been exciting to see how much bullshit is being unearthed and how many layers of just plaque on everyone's brains are finally starting to lift. And almost feels like just this reckoning. And I think I also wanted to acknowledge just the legacy of people that have been doing abolition work that have been \u2026 the black writers and activists that have been so brave to vocalize the truth of all of everything that's finally becoming visible enough for the mainstream to start getting on board.", "3589": "It's just what I feel like that's possible to retroactively \u2026 when you think your whole life, that you're just like screaming at a wall and then finally someone listens to you. It's not enough. You can't remove the fact that there's been this just all this gaslighting and oppression like an entire lifetime. It doesn't go away just in a moment. But thinking that there could be some visibility and that some of this could start to lift, it really just makes me wonder, we have such a long way to go and what can happen. And it just makes me feel so grateful for the resilience of everyone that's been in this line of fighting.", "3590": "That have like lived and died to vocalize what is kept silence who didn't stop screaming. And I'm just like so grateful that that voice is reaching enough of a pitch that the world is starting to listen to it. And it still just feels so heavy and so tragic that it's just the beginning. I just feel a lot of humility around that and just a daily recognition of all those things. Yeah. I think I'm noticing that.", "3591": "Yeah. I'm really grateful for Maliah you're saying the phrase trying to be hopeful. And Wido, a lot of the things you just said. I've been struggling to name an orientation to this latest insurrection that isn't completely cynical and doesn't anticipate just the recreation of all the things that we hate and oppose. And pure bliss that people are discovering abolition and they're discovering mutual aid and they're throwing down for sex workers or whatever. I struggled to articulate the middle space, which I think is what you too just described of trying to be hopeful and trying to see the good in this, while there is still just incredible suffering.", "3592": "Acting like what do I can't get over, like you telling me that you had a friend go missing and then that's how you discovered. That's how it ended. That's everything on some level and nothing that's happening right now is going to change that. And so, yeah, I take that seriously and I share the like \u2026 yeah, I'm a move that anyone is trying to be hopeful. Honestly, anybody who's been in this long enough, it would be so easy to just say, \"The world's fucked and it'll always be fucked.\" So I'm very moved by that.", "3593": "Thank you, Rhea. Thank you for just all your reflections so far. I think because we're going to end soon, I'm going to just ask this question and then we can have any follow-up questions. But in terms of your work, what specific changes would you like to see that would support and improve the conditions of it? What tangibly or materially, or even emotionally could help support you in doing the work that you do?", "3594": "I might say that, for me, the most tangible thing that would support my work is the space to do it. And sometimes it's hard to find the space when you're trying to provide something that's like actually affordable. For instance, I've been practicing hypnotherapy for a while and I feel like it's a really powerful, impactful way to work with the nervous system, trauma, addiction, a lot of blocks that keep us silent. I feel like it's a really empowering modality to work with people. And I find it really hard to have a really solid practice, but only a bedroom to practice in.", "3595": "And I also know it's COVID, we're not supposed to be breathing or talking closely to each other, but I'm so past that point that if people are like looking for my services, I just feel frustrated that I don't know where to do it. So that's maybe not the biggest sweeping thing, but sometimes I wish there was more space and that it was like possible to survive providing everything that I would want to provide, accessibly. It feels infuriating that we can't just all show up sharing the gifts that we have and that somehow, we need to be paid to do it. It seems like such a roadblock to have to not just have immediate resources available, like food and shelter and space to work.", "3596": "Well, I totally agree with you, Wido. I had an office. I was renting an office downtown Brooklyn. I called partnered with another agency and that was taking \u2026 they didn't pay the rent. So, I subsequently was they evicted with all of their office stuff. Hello. It's all in my house right now. They did not tell me until the last minute they had not paid the rent. For somebody that's black and trans and marginalized, I felt abandoned again and homeless again, even though it was a workspace. It kept work out of my home. I will say one of the things I'm looking for is for us to have a space where we feel comfortable.", "3597": "I really don't want to have an office that's connected to another office. I want us to have a space that's created for us, with all the aspects and possibilities of healing and growth. I don't want people to leave broken. I want to create a better utopia for us on all levels. That means lobbying. That means housing. That means sex work. That means every fucking aspect that helps as get to sustainability. I have so many brothers and sisters all over the world that are suffering right now. I don't even know if I'm going to see them again. After Sunday, I don't even know if I'm going to make it out of this because I was around 15,000 people.", "3598": "But I will tell you we are strong people. And the other side, I'm going to see a stronger, bigger, better, and brighter, and just be on the other side to embrace even the negative. I just want to clear up one thing. So [redacted] cleared up the $10,000 thing by changing the contract that they written horribly. It was one organizer. They winded up donating almost 50,000 after they corrected that problem. So if you clearly have conversations with people and let them know where they're wrong, like you are asking for sex workers information, and that is wrong, there might be a better outcome on the other end of it.", "3599": "And like I said, if you ever want or need my help, I'll come and get it going for you. This is what we do. Community takes care of community. And I'm going to see more of that.", "3600": "I'm piecing of Aviva 's question into the chat here, so folks can refer back to it, if other people want to try to talk about it. Maliah, do you have other any thoughts on this?", "3601": "Yeah. I have always been critical of the nonprofit Industrial complex and it was already said before, how everyone's still has rent to pay. Everyone still has bills to pay. And as much as everyone needs time to grieve and process all of the loss and suffering that we're experiencing right now, people still have to make their coin. And I think it's been really challenging for me in that, being a supervisor and being an admin, I've had to constantly advocate for myself to be able to continue working from home. And to me, it's just like, can I just say that I'm a person living with HIV and I'm a trans woman of color and shouldn't that be honored?", "3602": "Shouldn't that be enough to be able to work from home and to feel safe? But instead I've had to constantly have conversations with HR and different department heads and it's been even more exhausting. It's like I'm already busting my ass and doing the work. And then here I am, having to do more work to protect myself. So that's been frustrating. I think I've had a lot of resentment towards my agency and the ways that they've just been pushing for more productivity when people are really burned out. But I do understand that it is a business and people have to \u2026 we still have operations to run and we have people to serve.", "3603": "But I think one thing that I've done was, we had to have furloughs recently and I felt like the best decision for myself was to volunteer myself to be furloughed. And although it wasn't a guarantee that it would be granted, I found out today that I will be furloughed and I will have access to unemployment benefits and I'll have access to my health insurance. And then thankfully, they also gave us a fairly nice stipend to support with any financial hardships that may come with the delay of getting on unemployment. But right now, I think I'm grateful that that was an opportunity and I'm grateful I took it.", "3604": "I know not everyone at my agency was able to take that opportunity. But yeah, sometimes I just wish there was more. And with all the protests and murders happening recently, leadership is so quick to express empathy and sympathy. But again, I think that's where it's not enough. It's like, let people take the day off, let people take a week off if they need to. So, I really pushed for that and sent an email to our diversity, equity and inclusion committee to suggest that people should be able to donate their paid time off to other staff who want to take time off to grieve. Still hasn't been put into place.", "3605": "There still hasn't really been discussed as an agency, but I know the people on the committee have reached out to me and thanked me for that idea. But I just think now is the time when we can be taking more action instead of just empty words are not enough. And yeah, I wish people would be a little bit more thoughtful and intentional on how they can support their staff during these two pandemics that are happening. And I just wish that there was more room and space for staff to see their employees as human beings instead of just another worker who has to get the work done. I don't think I've been seeing enough of that recently.", "3606": "Well, thank you, everyone so much were mindful of the time. And it's really been quite extraordinary the depth and substance that people shared. Any closing thoughts that people want to share before we end?", "3607": "I love you all and I want you to take care of yourself physically, mentally and spiritually. Get everything you need to get so you can be okay, then you can help the world.", "3608": "Yeah, I really want to thank everyone. I'm going to be thinking about all of you and your words and your vibrations for a long time. And this is a really deep experience. Thanks for inviting me. I'm just so grateful for the dialogue and the receptivity and all of your depths and the fights you're fighting. And I love you too. Thank you. Please also take care of yourselves. I wish that for all of you too.", "3609": "Yeah. This has just been this amazing reminder for me that expertise is something that we should always situate in people's lived experience. Kayana we saw an expert. So figure Kayana for example. But like, Wido and Maliah, there's so much that I think that you know and that I wish I could learn from that. I hear you saying stilling stories also about how it's not being credited. And so, I don't know, these conversations leave me with this like very deep desire that people \u2026 the thing that can change in the world is that we situate expertise and envision in people's actual lived experience.", "3610": "And so, I hope that that is a thing that happens more and more to you. Because yes, I'm very, very moved by the things that you've said. And I love you guys. And if anybody ever needs like lawyer energy, like lawyer dad energy, just call me. I'll throw down.", "3611": "Yeah. I just want to echo everything that was said. And I haven't met all of you, but I'm very honored to have shared this dialogue and space with you all tonight. And I definitely feel all the love going around and I want to give it back to you all.", "3612": "I want to encourage people to think about sharing your own story with the New York City Trends Oral History Project. And you can listen to Cayenne's interview and interviews with about 200 other just incredible people talking about their lives. And all of you would be very welcoming to be interviewed Aviva or myself, or we have another volunteer of the summer, Elliot, are all available to do interviews. And we'd really love to post your story more in depth than is really possible in a group discussion. But if we can figure out all the release forms and everything, we also are excited about posting this conversation to the Trends Oral History Project archives, as well as the Local Voices Network where it's headed. So, thank you everyone. In the closing words of Aviva?", "3613": "I am just speechless. I feel all the warmth also. Yeah, I'm just like lit up now, also, in my house alone. Yeah, I think we're going to stop recording. If you have any questions at all, reach out to me. If there's anything that feels like you said that you want to redact, they're going to transcribe this and you can do that. They have the ability to go through the transcription of it. And yeah, any other questions related to the recording just let me know.", "3614": "Thank you. Continue. I have begun recording at this time and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationship with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policymakers and members of the media.", "3615": "To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on the issues. In this conversation you are invited to share stories about your experiences with health and wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing your personal health information.", "3616": "Now, this conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project. At Cortico's discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico the operator of Local Voices Network to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in media that improve our understanding of one another.", "3617": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in the local newspaper or website or to be broadcast on a local radio station or appear elsewhere including of the forms of media. So please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say, aye. Now I'm going to go around. This is going to be the order. Now let me just write it down so I don't forget because I'm getting a little older now. So this is the order how we're going to do in answering questions. So first we'll be Chaz, then we'll be Juan, then we'll be [Zavon 00:02:54]. Then we'll be Chris, Angel, then Joshua. Yes. So Chaz, if you can unmute yourself and please say if you agree.", "3618": "I agree.", "3619": "Juan?", "3620": "I agree.", "3621": "Zavon?", "3622": "I agree.", "3623": "Chris?", "3624": "I agree.", "3625": "Angel?", "3626": "I agree.", "3627": "Joshua?", "3628": "I agree.", "3629": "Thank you guys. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and to learn from one another's in this conversation and to support those goals. We have a few guidelines for our conversation. There are also on the materials we sent with your confirmation email. Number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns. Number four, stay curious, ask honest questions. Number five, pause, take time for reflection. Number six, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. I don't need to know your [inaudible] Joshua. Let's get some coffee.", "3630": "Number seven, when possible close unnecessarily programs, applications and notifications and put your phones on silent. All right, so is everyone on board with the guidelines? Is there anything else you guys want to add or change? No? Okay. So for these virtual conversations we are going to use a modified circle process, which each person will take a turn on posting the order which I already did. Again, Chaz, Juan, Zavon, Chris, Angel and Joshua. So I'll help transition. Now, you can always pass or you can ask to pass and for us to go back. Does everyone understand that?", "3631": "So let me repeat. So again, when I ask the questions we're going to go in order from Chaz, Juan, Zavon, Chris, Angel and Joshua. Now you can always pass the question or you can pass and ask for us to come back. Does anyone have any questions about the process? You can always unmute. Angel, you're good? Okay, good to begin. We want to do a quick round of introductions. Please share your first name, in addition to your first name, please share a little bit about your background info, about who you are, where you live, or what you do and a value that is important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today.", "3632": "So for this round, I'll start. So my name is Reggie, my background, I'm Haitian, I'm part of the LGBT community. I currently live in The Bronx. The one value to me that's really important and what brought me here today, I think it's so important that our voices are heard. Just like empowerment that you guys are very familiar that I coordinate. It's so important when we talk about community, we are all the same, but we all different. We all have different views and opinions on things and in turn we would need different solutions. So I think it's really important to have a diverse group of people to make the community better. So Chaz, you are up. And let me know if you guys want me to repeat anything, if you want me to repeat the question, go ahead Chaz.", "3633": "Hi, my name is Chaz. I am black. I'm from The Bronx. And the reason I joined the conversation today is because I feel like oftentimes people who look like me or people of my community are often misrepresented in healthcare, they don't get the stuff they're needing. So I'm just happy to share my voice and speak for people who look like me. Thank you.", "3634": "Okay [inaudible 00:07:35].", "3635": "My name is Juan, I'm Puerto Rican and I'm from The Bronx and the value that's most for me is for people to hear your voice because a lot of times, like for myself I thought my voice didn't matter and so I [inaudible] and got comfortable with myself. So especially like I just want to express my opinion and what I feel and my dislikes and likes.", "3636": "Thank you. Zavon?", "3637": "Hi, my name is Zavon, I'm black, I'm from the Caribbean Island of Mustique but I'm living in The Bronx. And one reason I decided to be a part of this is to actually gather more information on the little that I know so that in the future I'll be able to be a part of something and be able to look and say, \"I made a change by letting my voice be heard.\"", "3638": "Thank you, Chris.", "3639": "Hi, my name is Chris I'm from The Bronx but I live in Queens now. One value I have I think, the reason why I joined the [inaudible] is because I wanted to be a voice for those people who didn't have a voice for themselves or those people who were still deciding on what they wanted to do and who they want it to be, similar to how I was in a position not long ago. And I wanted to help them and guide them in ways that I didn't have help when I was going through the same thing.", "3640": "Thank you. And, Angel.", "3641": "Hi, you guys. So my name is angel I'm 22 years old, background I'm Dominican. As I get older I think it's very important to kind of be able to be an advocate for the community that you represent. And yeah, I think I wanted to just be a part of this just so that I can continue to remind people my age and people of my demographic and my community, just to learn how to advocate for yourself and really learn how to speak for the many positions that many people cannot relate to or speak to.", "3642": "Thank you. Last but not least Joshua.", "3643": "Hey, so I'm Joshua. I'm originally from Los Angeles, I currently live in The Bronx. What else did you say we needed to do before?", "3644": "Sure. So a little bit about a background of yourself, where you live or what do you do and a value that is important to you and ow it's related to what brought you here today.", "3645": "Yeah, so I'm originally from Los Angeles. I'm a professional dancer, I'm also in the ballroom scene. Like you all said, it's important to have a voice in the community, being a part of the community and being black or of color. Sometimes our voices aren't heard. So I think that it's important to speak up when we can and we have the platform here, so I want it to be a part and a [inaudible 00:11:09].", "3646": "Thank you. All right. Well, thank you guys for sharing on. The next thing we would like to do is invite you to share a little bit about yourselves since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing look like and feel like to you. So next, think of a time place or story where you felt like you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt the way you felt when you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at that time? How did you feel? So we'll go around one time one at a time to share our stories, please remember that this is being recorded. So we ask that you do not disclose any sensitive personal health information or use the names of other people when telling stories.", "3647": "So I'll start. And if you guys want me to repeat that, I definitely will, because sometimes I need to repeat it for myself. You know what I mean? Like I'll be like, let me just make sure I cover all the basics. So, where I felt the best in terms of health and wellness I usually always say this, I feel like especially when I'm now in my 30s, but when I was in my 20s, I was having my deep coming in and out, I think it keeps logging off for him.", "3648": "I always say when I moved to The Bronx back in 2014, when you go into Job Corps they do a full assessment, and that was the first time I ever got in a HIV test. And I just remember even in all the times that I used to get it before being really scared just because the way my provider at the time used to ask me the questions, I used to be so uncomfortable. So I'd be like, \"No, I'm not having sex. I'm good.\" But when I went to Job Corps, it's kind of mandatory.", "3649": "So when I got it done and in learning with my trade at the time in Job Corps, which is CMA learning about how it's so important to be honest with your providers so you can get the best care. I just felt after, like, wow, this place, honestly, at first I thought they were trying to be nosy. Why do they want to know my business? I already got my provider you don't need to know my business. But it really help me open up to think like, wow, I really need to be open and honest with my provider so I can get the best care. So that's a time where I really felt like the best, because I feel like sometimes as a young person you don't feel like anything's wrong, or you just go to the doctor when something's wrong.", "3650": "But I know that I was young sex was definitely a thing. So that's when I felt the best and what [inaudible] that supported that. Basically me getting tested and me learning about that in my sort of certified medical assistant class, and just learning about how it's so important and learning really the stigmas with HIV and STIs, it really opened my eyes especially because I had a family member that was affected by that. I felt great, I felt good, I felt empowered because I was educated. You know what I mean? Sometimes we go off. Sometimes I feel that I will go based off things people tell you, but I liked that the facts were there. So I felt empowered, I felt educated and I can educate others.", "3651": "So again, the order Chaz, Juan, Zavon, Chris, Angel and Joshua. I'm just going to repeat the question one more time. So again think of a time place or story where you felt that you were at best in terms of health and wellness Chaz? What can you remember about it? What are some of the factors that supported it and how did it make you feel?", "3652": "My story is similar to yours. I've always been very conscious about my health because I do come from a family where I think two of my family members have HIV. So they've always taught me to be careful and be safe with everything that I'm doing and I just always stuck with that in my mind. But one specific time when I was in high school, I was exercising constantly and just being around people that actually cared about my wellbeing and healthiness. So I felt more motivated to be healthy with my own self and my choices.", "3653": "What were some factors that supported [inaudible 00:16:16]?", "3654": "Just having a really good support system and being able to openly talk about my health problems or anything that I was scared of with people who I know give me a straightforward answer and tell me like, \"Oh, you need to go see a professional for this.\"", "3655": "Thank you. Juan.", "3656": "Repeat the first one again, the first question, I'm sorry.", "3657": "Not a problem. Sure. So think of a time place or story where you felt that you were at your best in terms of health and wellness?", "3658": "It would definitely have to be when I came out because I was so much hiding, because growing up in a Spanish household, especially with an older cousin, it always showed that you have to be a manly man. So growing up I always felt like me being gay I had to hide it and do risky behavior. So when I finally came out, I was more expressive of, I need to go get myself a check every three months and stuff like that. Because before when I was doing risky behavior, I was so scared of asking, I need to get a STD or HIV check because I was hiding myself. So once I came out, I felt more open of getting my wellness checked.", "3659": "Thank you. Zavon.", "3660": "So point where I felt like I was at my best, I would say probably a year ago. I decided that it's time to take it for myself more. Even though three years ago, I made the decision to become celibate. Gain strength to say, \"Well, okay, I can move forward.\" And ignore the facts that even though as a gay person being a young time, I would say \"Well, okay, I need this and I need to take care of myself more.\" So I feel like making that decision to look after myself first as opposed to putting people before me like I always used to, I felt like from then coming up until now I feel like I've been doing a great job and I feel real good on the inside and outside.", "3661": "Thank you. Chris.", "3662": "I would say about the time when I think around senior year of high school, I think it was the most healthiest and the best I've ever felt. Because I think at around that time I was young and I didn't know much about certain things as I do now in terms of sex and sex health. And I feel like at that point in time, I was becoming more of an adult and knowing more to take care of myself and know how to handle myself a little bit more than I usually did. So I think that was definitely the most educational time for myself. And not only that, but I had more sources at hand in terms of health, more outreach was available around that time. So I was able to have more educational knowledge about stuff that I didn't know.", "3663": "Thank you. Angel.", "3664": "So I would say, honestly I think now is probably the healthiest and I'm most aware that I've been of certain things. I think that's like an accumulation and a combination of just adulting and also kind of like knowing your worth. So I know now that some of the behaviors, how I used to [inaudible] before and how I used to not really pay mind to as much as who is deserving of your body and your time. And I also feel like that also ties into a lot of the things that you eat, or conscious of what you put in your body. So honestly, I think it's been an accumulation of things but I feel like now it's probably the healthiest that I've ever been and also I feel like that also comes up a lot of confidence. Just putting a lot of value into yourself and knowing what's important for you is not going to be important for others. And not judging other people because I don't.", "3665": "Thank you. Last but not least Joshua.", "3666": "You have to keep giving me the introduction, don't you?", "3667": "Sorry. I apologize.", "3668": "No. It's fine. I was sitting here trying to figure out when was the best time that I felt like I was my healthiest. I can't really give you an answer because I dance professionally and I'm always constantly aware of what's going on with my body. So I can't really answer that question right now. I guess I would feel like I'm not the healthiest because I'm not dancing, but for the past seven years I've been constantly go into the doctor, even when I contracted HIV I still was going to the doctor every three months, continually going to the doctor every three months. Mentally I felt like I was good. I was still exercising and working out. So I can't really say there was a specific time.", "3669": "Well, we'll go around one more time to share our stories. Please remember that this is being recorded. So we ask that you do not disclose any like any sensitive health information or use the names of any other people telling the stories. Oh, I'm sorry. We already did this. I'm sorry all. All right. So we want to move on to the conversation about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly and share about either your neighborhood, community, or your social community.", "3670": "When you are responding to questions, if you are speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what you're thinking of when you share your story. I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope this will be a time for some back and forth among you as you share your stories. I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places or things have positively contributed to your, or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. So do you guys want me to repeat that one more time? Yes?", "3671": "You're going to have to repeat it a few times.", "3672": "Not a problem. And we'll start with Chaz. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, things that you feel that contributed to your community's health and wellbeing? You can share a story or your experience that can help us understand that better.", "3673": "So I guess for me it will be BX Empowerment because when I found BX Empowerment I went through a really bad situation with a boy. So I thought I had contracted HIV. So I had called Reggie and he just helped me fell calm and just sorted my things on and he was like, \"You're fine, don't worry.\" And it just really was really comforting that I could have somebody to talk to. Then they also directed me to a whole bunch of other services, like The Oval where I go now to get my checkups every three months. So, yeah, I think that's working pretty well for me.", "3674": "Thank you. Juan, same thing. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some people, places that have positively contributed to your health and wellness, in your community's health and wellness?", "3675": "Just like Chaz, I would say BX Empowerment because before I joined BX Empowerment, I didn't know anywhere else that give education on safer sex and condoms and lube and to know your status. Even if you know your status, to get better education on your status. So I would definitely say definitely BX Empowerment because they helped me to always think about having safer than having riskier sex.", "3676": "Thank you. I just want to go reread the first paragraph because I want you also guys to think very broadly. I love that you guys are giving me a lot of personal, but we want to move on to the conversation about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we want you guys to think of community broadly and share about your neighborhood community or social community when you're responding to the questions. Okay? But I love that because BX Empowerment is a community thing. So we're going to move on to Zavon. Zavon? Oh, there you are sorry. I'm getting old. So again, same question. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some people, places or things that have positively contributed to your community's health and wellbeing?", "3677": "So I would start off by, like everybody said, the BX Empowerment group because without them I probably would have never had a gay friend and not only them, but also for Job Corps because then I got the opportunity to come out here and make an advancement on my life and move forward. But in regards to help with the community and hopes and so forth, I feel like maybe something can be put in place. We as a community won't be scared to open up to family members because that may have been the thing back then, but it still affects some of us now and going forward so that if things may be rough, at least we'll be getting the acceptance from our family members much more than how we what would have gotten it back then.", "3678": "Thank you. Chris, same question. Do you want me to repeat it?", "3679": "No. I think one changing thing in my community I think is definitely social media for me. I think how I got to know, I wouldn't want to say just BX Empowerment, but how I got to know BX Empowerment was through social media from a friend. So it was more so I think social media has the way of connecting people not just within your own community, but in other communities adjacent to yours and meeting new people and finding out information that you didn't already know. So I think social media for me is one.", "3680": "Thank you. So definitely social media. Okay, excellent. I'm sorry, Angel.", "3681": "So yeah, like everyone said, I'll just say it again. BX Empowerment I think does a really good job at like exposing people to a lot of things that we shouldn't start normalizing as far as when it comes to HIV and status updating. I also think that as far as the community, I think I'd love to see providers that look like me. I love to see whether they have the last name, whether they come from where I come from. I definitely think that representation matters when it comes to going to a provider because I think that you, you want to feel comfortable with the person that is taking care of you. And obviously I think that whether it's ethnicity or race that common link brings comfortability into the situation.", "3682": "I think that they're doing a better job as far as bringing in healthier foods into our supermarkets and stuff like that. So as far as right now, representation is getting better. Food could be better, but it's getting there. And yeah, I'm seeing a lot more outreach as well. So I think that outreach is working, whether people take it or not, I think the initiative that people see that other people are taking is also amazing for our community.", "3683": "Thank you.", "3684": "No problem.", "3685": "Joshua?", "3686": "Yeah. I'm going to need you to repeat it.", "3687": "Not a problem. So I'm just going to repeat it all again but-", "3688": "I want you to do it section by section because you keep going and you know me.", "3689": "Yes. I apologize. So basically in a nutshell, what in your community you feel is working well to support your health and wellbeing? And when I say community think broadly, like what do you feel is working? What are some people, places or things that you feel have positively contributed to your, or your community's health and wellbeing?", "3690": "Like pretty much everyone said, but I don't want to just say BX Empowerment because I do know about some of the other agencies. I think that you guys are doing a really great job with sexual health. Providing condoms, providing the lube, providing the testing, STD and HIV testing at balls and also at your locations. I think that that's great. I actually don't know about BX Empowerment, but I know one of the other agencies, they also offer to speak to somebody from mental health. And I think that even talking about mental health is really great for the community and not just everyone in the community, specifically black people, black and Latinos, because I don't know for whatever reason. But it's almost like shunned upon to go and talk to somebody or seek help when it comes to mental health. So I think that that's great. Did I answer the question?", "3691": "Yeah. For sure. Oh, that click sound.", "3692": "I'm sorry.", "3693": "It's all good. Thank you guys for sharing. I also want you guys, I love your answers. Does anybody want to comment on what somebody else was saying that that works well? It seems like there's a comment of community outreach, as far as the BX Empowerment community outreach on social media, community outreach within the community, community outreach at gatherings like the underground ballroom scene. So is there anything that you guys want to comment or talk about as far as maybe even any concerns about health and wellness within the community? And again, we can start on from Chaz. So if you don't get to just say pass, but if you guys want to maybe comment on something somebody says and also talk the talk about is there any concerns. Chaz.", "3694": "I think Alex had said something about being able to talk about it more openly with your families, which I think is cool in the sense of, yeah, but in the real world, it's like, that's going to be hard because kids do get kicked out for asking questions like that because it kind of exposes them in a way. Because then the parents think like, what are you doing? So I don't think that is a very [inaudible] thing, but as far as having somewhere to talk about it and with people I think that is a great idea.", "3695": "Thank you. Juan.", "3696": "I want to piggyback off of what Angel and Joshua said. It's good to have doctors or providers of your own skin color because you feel a little bit more bond with that, especially about the mental health wellness, because I suffer from depression and bipolar. So it's just like is really good for me to talk to somebody instead of just bottling up then I go kaboom. So I definitely appreciate that.", "3697": "Thank you. Zavon?", "3698": "So for me I think like Juan and everybody else said having a healthcare provider that's of your own because I could remember back then I had a doctor who was, I wouldn't say white, and sometimes I go for my checkup and he would make slick comments and pass it on. And I just used to ignore him because I know my temper and if I'm to react things can get real messy. So once I decided to make a change and I got a doctor of my skin color and so forth, I was able to go to my appointments more often and have conversations to the point where I felt comfortable, as opposed to when I had the doctor before who made his sleek comments and said what he wanted to see. So I feel like having a healthcare provider that's off your own, you'll be able to best connect with that person.", "3699": "Thank you. Chris?", "3700": "I think it's true, not only I think it's the healthcare provider alone, but I think it's just finding people that are not necessarily they don't have to be your background, but find something in common you have with somebody else that has the same goal as you and ambitions, and someone who you want to go to when you have someone to talk to because mental health is something that isn't talked about as much as it should be. It's something that's underrated. So I think definitely finding that only a healthcare provider that looks like you and maybe has the same background as you, but it's finding a group of friends that also have the same look as you or also have the same goals as you and this part of the community.", "3701": "Thank you. Angel?", "3702": "So I think there's some of the things that could be problematic. Like again I said, as far as the food we could be doing a lot better job with some of the foods that we put in some of our local groceries. I think that a lot of times the food that we find in there that are \"the good stuff\" is obviously priced a little higher for us, unfortunately. And I think also we can be problematic in a sense where we look for certain services or certain things. We expect these things to be handed to us sometimes and sometimes it's just a matter of taking responsibility and looking for these places where you can feel that you can identify or have the services that you need.", "3703": "Because a lot of people won't get the services that they need and want because it's not close enough to them. So I think we can be problematic in that sense where we take responsibility for ourselves and sometimes say, \"Hey, I'm going to go every week uptown because this place is providing the services that I need.\" I think that we could just be a lot better as a community.", "3704": "Thank you. Joshua?", "3705": "Pass.", "3706": "All right. So we're going to move on to the next question. What are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better. So learning about your community's wellbeing.", "3707": "One question, I'm sorry, is this question exclusive to health and wellness or can we dive in just a little deeper?", "3708": "Absolutely. If you want to dive a little deeper, I also want to make sure that we do stick on topic but absolutely, if you want to elaborate or broaden it up, definitely. And I want you guys to also, if you feel that you want to comment, maybe somebody talking and you thought of something, make sure you guys do have that chat box but also putting questions or comments as well. So again, let me just read it one more time. What are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? All right. So share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. Chaz.", "3709": "I kind of don't understand the question. Are you talking about like how well we handled the pandemic as far as... [crosstalk 00:38:56].", "3710": "So when you think about community, what your community means to you, whether it's your neighborhood community, whether it's your LGBT community, your personal network of family, of friends. What are you learning now especially during this pandemic about the community's wellbeing? What are you learning especially during this pandemic about your community's wellbeing and their resiliency during this pandemic? How can I say this? Alex, you can try and if you like to or anybody else. So I'll pass you for now I'll come back to you. Does anybody else just want to jump in, Joshua?", "3711": "I'll go or I'll try and go on if it's not right you can tell me.", "3712": "No. There's no right or wrong answers here.", "3713": "I think that, well, number one, the pandemic just came out of nowhere and made everybody just flop on their ass, but excuse my French. But I think what I realized during the pandemic, even now, more so now than then, because I feel like everybody was panicking at the beginning, but now I feel like there's a sense of togetherness, and this might be off topic but with all of the protesting and the riots going on. I just feel a sense of togetherness. I know a lot of people, I have friends myself that were really struggling because they were out of work or families going through it because of COVID-19 or whatever the case may be. And if they didn't have it, they had a friend that could help them out or some of their house members could help them out. So there's a sense of togetherness like you're not alone, you're not by yourself. You have people that can help you and support you, you know what I mean?", "3714": "Thank you. Angel.", "3715": "I would say that I agree with him. I think that we have definitely formed this bond over a common struggle. I would also say that on the negative side of wellness for the community, I think that now is a time where we should start building on a lot of better coping mechanisms and how to deal with just life in general around us. And I feel like I've seen a lot of nasty, I don't want to say nasty. But a lot of behaviors that aren't as healthy or just coping mechanisms that aren't good for the person themselves. So I've seen a lot of that. I've seen a lot of, I wouldn't say ignorance, but I think that it's also showing us that how to better handle our finances and how to really go about things like that when it comes to money.", "3716": "But also the destruction help of how money can really affect us in our wellbeing. I feel like money, we have seen that with this pandemic. What else? And as far as resilience, I think like I said, again, the bonding over a common struggle, I feel like a lot of the communities or communities within themselves, they've had a lot of discussions when it comes to topics that I guess they've never wanted to touch on or never really got the time to touch on because everyone was so busy that they're having these healthy discussions now which is I think good for communities in general.", "3717": "Thank you Angel. Anybody else care to share or want to touch on it? Chaz, go ahead.", "3718": "I just thought of something. I think this pandemic hit people really hard, especially as far as like health care. Because I have a lot of like trans friends who weren't able to get accessible to their hormones and just regular trans care in general. Especially because a lot of the trans people I know rely on sex work, the part of sex work is the fantasy and what they [inaudible 00:43:16]. But it's like how can you achieve that if you can get what you need from your healthcare provider as far as that? But yeah, and that can take a lot of strain as far as like on somebody's mental life. Because I'm pretty sure she was like, \"I'm not getting my hormones so I feel like I'm shifting backwards a little bit.\" It feels like I'm taking 10 steps back from where I originally started.", "3719": "Thank you. Anybody else care to share? Like Chris, Zavon, Juan. No? Go ahead Angel.", "3720": "Sorry I have one more thing kind of off the topic. But I would also really want the community to start getting a lot more informed about politics and policies that could affect our communities because, again, I'm not here to tell anyone what to do or how they should do it. But there are people that we sometimes point people as bad guys, and they're not as bad as you may think they are. Or there are a lot of policies that are just affecting us more than they're helping us. So I think if we were all to just get a little more informed and just stop associating certain things with certain people and things like that, I think that it would benefit our mental health and our wellness in general honestly. That's what I wanted to say.", "3721": "Thank you for sharing. I'm also going to just also add to that what I was thinking. You did touch on a lot of things. I have met a lot of people, especially within the LGBT community as far as their wellbeing is not taking it as seriously during the pandemic. I've seen a lot of people, like you said, as far as coping mechanisms with the stress of what's going on, indulging more on risky stuff like definitely drinking more, smoking more. What I will say is, and to go back on community outreach, I have received more of those phone calls during this time. So I know it's definitely important that community outreach and knowing that person, that you feel that you can call or that person that is knowledgeable or has access or to get the resources is really important.", "3722": "So I think that's something that I definitely seen. But I love the fact that especially within the community, that people are still reaching out and they're just not staying quiet. So I do like that. So I just wanted to say that. Now, I would like to bring in the voice of someone who participated in a conversation in the Local Voices Network recently. I want you to imagine that this person is in the room with us and listen closely to their comments. I'll then invite you to share any responses and insights you gained from listening to these comments.", "3723": "The first things that come to mind just for the sake of time is just like a systemic change in the way that we do things. From a top down level, from the big guys up there that make the decisions, to the ones that employ the services. Just making sure there's no question that there is, social, economic and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels and that it affects our health. And if we can do a way with that, where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals across the board.", "3724": "That if I'm walking down Corona in my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care is as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan. There's going to be no change, same quality of care there that's the first thing that pops to my head.", "3725": "Thank you. So would anyone like to share what insight reactions or memories came to the mind from listening to this?", "3726": "I agree with her especially within experience in my family and just stuff I've been reading online. I've been reading a lot of like horror stories when it comes to like the health care system, as far as black women getting less treatment more than other people because the doctors aren't disbelief or other racial stereotype that come with being black as far as we're dramatic or we're overly sensitive or they just feel like they just don't take us seriously sometimes when we come with our medical issues. And that can lead to us dying at increasing rates and stuff of that nature. So I do think she was 100% correct as far as systemically changing the whole healthcare system and the way that they operate based off race, which is completely true.", "3727": "Thank you. Anybody else have any reactions, memories came to mind when I'm listening to this? Juan.", "3728": "I definitely agree with her where she said they should be the same if she go to a doctor office in an urban community than going to a doctor office in Central Park. It shouldn't be a different it should all be the same way, because they're providing the same provide service.", "3729": "Thank you.", "3730": "I'll just also say like, again, when we all went back to the touching point of finding people that we resonate with and that are giving us, providing us these services, that's why it's even more important. Because I understand that sometimes we maybe want to see a different provider that doesn't look like us and they might not provide the services. And I'm not saying that it's correct. There's nothing right about racism and systematic racism, but everyone is entitled to their own practice and I feel like a lot of the times they're dumb they're not opening these businesses up to serve our demographic. I feel like sometimes we have to be a little more transparent and seeing that sometimes. I don't want to play devil's advocate but that's just how I feel sometimes.", "3731": "Go ahead.", "3732": "I completely disagree with her, but I mean, him, sorry, I didn't mean to [inaudible 00:50:25].", "3733": "We should go around and said preferred pronouns. I do apologize.", "3734": "Okay. I'll say him. I completely disagree with him especially when it comes to like the health care system. Your main goal should not be about what my skin color looks like. It should be how can you help me and how effectively can you help me? That is your job as a doctor, that's your job as a medical person, that's your job as a person. Just to be able to help me without whether my demographic fits your quota, that's a sound [inaudible 00:50:57]. Your first priority should be, are you going to make me better or can you make me better in the fastest time as possible? Yes. Okay. Thank you.", "3735": "I definitely get your points, I definitely agree with that about morally, sometimes as providers that's not what you signed up to do, your job is to provide care for everyone. But I feel like sometimes we just have to be a little more realistic and realize that they don't have to provide these services to us and we also don't have to be the consumer. Sometimes we can go and help out people in our community that are coming up to be providing for us. But I definitely agree with you that's not what you signed up for, you signed up to be a provider of all people, not just based on. But then that's where if you work for a public facility, then obviously you can't be that person.", "3736": "But if you work for your private practice, of course I know that it's wrong, but who am I to tell you the kinds of services that you [inaudible] and the people you want to see. It's almost kind of like when you open up a restaurant and this is the experience that you want to sell and the demographic you want to sell it to. A lot of the times those experiences aren't catered to us and we've continued to support them. So I think if we want to be that vocal and we want to be that transparent then I think that it's also our job to realize, okay, this is not for me I'm going somewhere else where I'm appreciated. But I agree with you 100%.", "3737": "Anybody else want to share? Zavon, did you get the chance? Because I know you've been coming in and out. Did you get a chance to listen to the video and do you have anything you want to share or things that came to mind?", "3738": "No. I basically didn't hear majority of you because I got a phone call, so I'm just listening to see if I can pick up on what I was said and see if I can piggyback off of somebody else's conversation.", "3739": "The question, what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? So does any insights, reaction, memories come to mind?", "3740": "I would say no because I've never experienced discrimination where I could go anywhere. Not to say that I'm bragging or anything, but I've never experienced going to a different neighborhood and getting treated differently in regards to healthcare. The only thing I can speak about is the fact that I had a white doctor but he was also situated in a black neighborhood. So I just felt like it was more him as a person as opposed to the work space that he was working for. So that's the only thing I can basically say that I can see affected me in the past.", "3741": "Thank you. I'm just going to quickly-", "3742": "Can I share something before we finish about that?", "3743": "Go ahead.", "3744": "So like I was born in Presbyterian Hospital, I can't remember, 96th Street. And growing up from there and going there when I was a child and then having come here to like Montefiore or Lincoln. I was thinking Lincoln is part of our reason is because I've always noticed the change, even the environment with a lot better in Presbyterian. They offered way more services than Presbyterian which was sad, especially because I grew up in a single parent household with a disabled mom. So she would have to travel all the way to Manhattan just to seek care when Montefiore or Lincoln is closer. I just thought that was so funny, why did my mom have to come all the way over here to a predominantly white neighborhood to get better care. I just thought it was really like, no, that is not okay.", "3745": "I'm sorry. Do you think that that had to do with the level of care or the level of resources?", "3746": "I think resources as far as that, because I feel like the hospitals here don't get as much funding or as much things to help better service people in our community.", "3747": "Very interesting. Thank you for sharing. So the next question and here's a question for more reflection. Given the conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would it feel like? So I can pause give you guys time to think. I'm going to repeat the question and just to go back quickly. One thing I will say in my response to that audio and I said a lot of times, and one of the reasons why I got into healthcare is I remember a situation where my mother who at the time was not diagnosed, but she told me about her status. And now she had leukemia. I remember a time, not a time, that was the last time it's hospital she went to until she went to the hospice facility. Anyone familiar with a hospice facility it's kind of like where you go if you have I think six months or less to live.", "3748": "And I just remember coming in and the door was wide open. I would say my mother's bed was here, the doctor was not even in the space where you do the close off. It was even farther than that with the door open. And I just remember him asking about my mother's status, even though she had leukemia and her thing was not going to get chemo, it was a religion. I think one thing that and I always say this a lot of times with either providers or people providing service and the reason I feel that they don't provide the best is because their beliefs, religion, and culture play a part of it. So this \"gentleman doctor\" I felt like it was his personal views on HIV.", "3749": "The doctor was standing very not close, the door was open and I could see the woman at the desk, you know what I mean? Because he was talking very loud and very away from her. So he was like, \"Hi, so what can I do?\" And I even felt some type of way, but I remember looking at my mother and you could just feel that she felt uncomfortable. But me not being educated and I'm like, \"Hey, can you just answer the doctor?\" But I felt like that was not actually a good privacy feeling. You're not even in the space, obviously you want to keep your distance whatever. But you are very far away acting from a distance and the door is open and you're talking loud. I just remember that, that's what came up to my mind when I was hearing her talk.", "3750": "So I think a lot of times, sometimes for people it's their personal views, beliefs, culture, religion, that kind of plays a part of not get getting the best care. So yeah, that's what came to mind. So let me go back to the next question on your reflection. Again, given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like and what would it feel like? So Chaz, we're going to start with you.", "3751": "I think a healthier community would look like to me is being able to get all services no matter what hospital you have to go to. I'd rather you be able to go to a hospital closer to you and get the same amount of services that let's say a hospital in Manhattan would or a hospital in Queens or something like that. Also, a healthier community would look like to me is being able to openly talk about stuff like HIV or AIDS or other STIs comfortably within schools, because that is a time where kids are having the most sexual activity, if you want to say. So I really see that would be a better place to come into play and getting healthier food, more access to things like mental health services.", "3752": "Juan.", "3753": "For me I [inaudible] New York City will be getting a lot of resources. Getting a lot of resources especially in the urban community where a single parent home, or if you live in a shelter like you probably wouldn't get, if you was in the two parent home or you live somewhere in the city. So I feel like that will be good in every hospital or every clinic had all the resources. And every hospital and every clinic have the needs that everybody needs at once. Instead of being like, oh, we can't provide it here, you have to go travel this far and not knowing that this person can't travel that far because of a disability or because they don't have the funds to. But again, that will be a better New York City.", "3754": "Thank you. Zavon?", "3755": "[inaudible] would first before equality, where everybody is open up to the same opportunities regardless of your race or your background. So if everybody is be able to get the same treatment regardless if you come from a single parent household or for somebody who don't have the funds that could say, \"Okay, I need, they thought of assistance and I can afford it.\" But there's something set in place where they can receive that service from that place, where they'll be able to be comfortable to say that, \"Okay, I don't want to go to this spot, but I can go here and feel better.\" Instead of being shut down and close the door in front of...", "3756": "Thank you. Chris.", "3757": "I said equal health opportunity for everyone, regardless of status, income, demographic background. More available resources in lower income communities. I know there's some in Queens, I think she mentioned it before, like Corona, Queens or LeFrak, or even in The Bronx anywhere to be honest. Give more outreach to those communities that are in need who don't have those resources. I said equal education as well. I say equal education mainly because a lot of people don't know that there's resources out there and that there are ways to help whatever health situation they may be in because a lot of people have certain things and don't, or they're unaware of the resources that are out there just because, nobody's out there pushing that information to them. So definitely the education.", "3758": "Thank you. Angel.", "3759": "So I think that we can always work on being healthier New York. I don't think we'll always be completely healthy or and also acknowledging that I think all facilities should have a number of places that they could cite or recommend other than just shutting your door and saying, \"We can't help you here.\" They should have places where they could recommend and stuff because it's also completely unrealistic to say, \"This place should offer all your services.\" But I think having connections to other services and references is also amazing. Because it has to become some level of compromise for us as well. And yeah, having better access to better food, a level of compromise, some references. I think that's good.", "3760": "Thank you. Joshua.", "3761": "Everyone pretty much said it all. Affordable healthcare, better eating, healthier options in the grocery stores and just even going to go get fast food stuff there should be healthier options. And the discrimination maybe, nobody should be denied services because of their skin color. Everyone should be able to go wherever they want, the healthcare should be free. But yeah, that's it for me.", "3762": "Thank you. I think we lost Juan. Right? I think so. I'm going to add to that a New York City would definitely be, I loved your answers and please feel free to comment if you hear something that you agree. But definitely I think I love something about additional resources. I think that would be great, additional resources especially if they can help. I think there also need should be to be a level of cultural competency. We always hear that word around but I think there needs to be an assessment or some type of training. Sorry someone kicked me out. Not a problem. Thank you Juan. Welcome back.", "3763": "I think it should be somewhat of a training and really a mental health assessment on all healthcare workers from front end staff to back end and all the way down to a doctor or a surgeon. Because as I said before I think religion culture and beliefs take a real especially within my community and when I see my community LGBTQ. I think that really takes a toll on why a lot of that I think people have lost faith in the health care system and going to receive help and services.", "3764": "So definitely making sure that people understand that you shouldn't discriminate against anyone else, whatever you believe in, however you were brought up and your religion. What have [inaudible] to believe that shouldn't take a part of you giving the best care. So definitely training for all on all type of different human beings whether it's LGBTQ, whether it's people of color especially like some of you guys that I heard, there could be let's just say a Christian who is not of color who is a provider but that providers should be taking classes especially if you're going to have a practice in the community that is widely of people of color. Definitely taking some accredited cultural competency classes. I think that's really important.", "3765": "Now we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question, I want everybody to pay attention. We're all here. Yes. For our last question we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'd like other people to hear? So we're going to take some time to reflect. This time around I'm going to let you guys, I know we've been having order but if you guys want to go right then and there, go for it. But again let me repeat that again, we invite you to share what is one thing that you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'd like other people to hear.", "3766": "I think it was from that recording, she said systemic change within our health system and that I feel like everybody should be on top of. That should be the most important thing because that is where we go to get taken care of, that is where we go to you know what we need to be healthy and productive people within society. I feel like we should systemically change everything in the way that the health providers view people of color and people who have disabilities. So yeah, I just want everybody to focus more on that.", "3767": "Thank you. I want to hear from everybody because everybody got a voice. Anybody-", "3768": "I definitely would say what Angel was saying when he was saying about the private practice. If they won't support us why will we support them and I think that's what a lot of people want to hear is just like. If you're talking about you want change and you want better support then why are you going to support people who don't support you and you should support the small business who does have what you need but you rather to a big a bigger business that doesn't really care for you or your [inaudible 01:09:40].", "3769": "Thank you. Did you just mute yourself that first?", "3770": "Yeah. I'm sorry.", "3771": "Thank you so much for sharing. Anybody else want to share one thing that you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'll like other people to hear? Chris, Joshua, Zavon, Angel. No?", "3772": "I'll say something. I want to say I definitely appreciate you Reggie when you said that it's beginning to be a very important and vital to educate or re-educate the staff on cultural needs or just different backgrounds and how to be culturally sensitive to their own important needs. Well even if it's being re educated every now and then I think it's very important because obviously the same way you learn medicine or whatever you're learning it's ever evolving and you're always learning something new. The same way should be for cultural beliefs and background. I think that you can never know enough about culture and people experiences. So I think that that's a very [inaudible 01:11:04].", "3773": "Thank you. Anyone else have anything else as far as that last question?", "3774": "Yeah. Talking about your mental health is important and I recommend that if anybody is having you know issues, whatever kind, if you haven't got a suicidal thoughts or depression or whatever the case may be that it's OK to talk to somebody because you're not alone ultimately.", "3775": "Thank you Joshua.", "3776": "So I'll say one thing that I will take with me is the fact that I think it was you Reggie who said you wasn't comfortable with your doctor at the time when he was asking you certain questions. I feel like for everybody they should be able to communicate with the person that they best connect with so that you know when questions are being asked they won't think twice about giving an answer or even she had the wrong, that could then lead to a misunderstanding of what prescription can be prescribed to you based on what you're going through at the time.", "3777": "I would take with me and she amongst others to say, \"Okay once you got a doctor, if you're not comfortable with that doctor always see if you can find someone better.\" Or [inaudible] what was between you and that person so that you guys can develop a better connection and move forward in life.", "3778": "Thank you.", "3779": "I have something to add. I would say definitely one thing I would take from this is that there's more resources out there now more than there's ever been before. And I think there's more networking to go around where you can get the resources that you need and some more providers than they were before. And if you right now because I went to the doctor the other day and it's like there's so much, she literally gave me a thick pamphlet of a whole bunch of other doctors what other specialties within the county, within New York City, within Queens, The Bronx. That I can also connect with and go to as well. So I think definitely that stuff like HIV and AIDS isn't a death sentence and there's ways you can combat that and not just do mental health deal but... what do you call it? Your healthcare provider.", "3780": "Thank you. I'll add what I'll take from this conversation that number one, the work that I do is very much needed. No. But what I will take from this and that I want everyone to really hear is that it's so important when we talk about, our health that we are talking to someone who is competent and who is not going to judge us because of their religion belief or culture. I know I said that but I think that's very important and within our community LGBT, because again growing up I was not comfortable. So it's also making sure that you know and you research and even asking certain personal network of friends or family members of that community, like who do you recommend? You know what I mean?", "3781": "Because sometimes we will go to certain places within our community because they're close locally thinking that we're going to get the best care or we'll go to I think Chaz was saying, like a reputable hospital and as we will say we will get it because we're not getting treated fairly or you feel an ounce of discrimination or you feel like you're not getting treated well from the way you are. So I think that's really something that's really important that I think that I want everyone to hear that I got from this. Those are all the questions that we have for you. Do you have any closing thoughts that you'd like to share or other general reflections on the conversation?", "3782": "I'll just say this, I've been doing a lot like self reflecting and a lot of research and stuff like that. I don't think we're ever going to get past the point, of course it's getting better as far as systematic racism when it comes to health care and things like that. But I will say I think that if we all just be a little more self-sufficient and stop all the time. I know it's sometimes and not all the time we play the victim role and start being victors that I think that we can all start reaping the benefits of our lives.", "3783": "Thank you Angel. Anybody else? Any last general reflections on the conversation closing thoughts?", "3784": "I agree with what Angel said and especially because I know a lot of LGBTQ youth who don't have their parents in their lives and they live in shelters and stuff like that. A lot of them don't take their health as a priority until it's like detrimental. So I do agree we as people need to start holding ourselves accountable for our own health as well.", "3785": "Thank you. Anyone else? No? Thank you all for coming and sharing your voices. Please before you guys leave make sure you click on the chat and complete the survey. It's really important to make sure we add everything all together. The survey brings everything all together but I really want to thank you guys for sharing and opening up and giving us your...", "3786": "So, there are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices in need of the community to candidates, local policy-makers and members of the media.", "3787": "So to this end, we're inviting people from different communities in different spaces to join these conversations. And like I mentioned earlier in this conversation, we want you to share your stories and experiences with health and well-being of your community, rather than sharing your personal health information.", "3788": "So Yule, am I missing anything before I go into the guidelines?", "3789": "No, we're good to go.", "3790": "Welcome, Miss Clay. Thank you for joining.", "3791": "No problem. Good evening. Sorry for my lateness.", "3792": "It's okay. We're happy to see you here. Thank you for joining us.", "3793": "I don't know if you heard some of my introduction, but we asked people to join this conversation so that way we can hear people's voices from different communities, to be able to inform policy when it comes to health in our community.", "3794": "So, this session is being recorded. If you want to change your name, you can do so now. I'm going to go over some guidelines, but just know that only the audio will be used to transcribe the information that we can share to inform the policy.", "3795": "Okay. Thank you so much.", "3796": "No problem. Welcome, ChaRon.", "3797": "Hello.", "3798": "Thank you for joining.", "3799": "So, I'm going to go over conversation guidelines. One, speak for yourself and find out of your own experiences. Two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share the time. Allow others to finish speaking. Take turns. Four, stay curious. Ask honest questions. Five, pause. Take time to reflect. Six, listen generously. Assume good intentions, while recognizing that your words have impact. Seven, when possible, close unnecessary programs and applications and notifications, and put your phone on silent.", "3800": "Is everyone on board with these guidelines, and is there anything else that we should add to help support this conversation?", "3801": "That's fine with me.", "3802": "Good for me as well.", "3803": "Perfect, thank you. Thank you. Thank you all. Let me put my phone on silent.", "3804": "So to start off, I first want to make sure that everyone is in agreement with participating in the conversation. So, I'm going to ask that everyone take turns saying, \"Aye,\" that they are in agreement to participate in this conversation. So I'll start off. Aye.", "3805": "Aye.", "3806": "Aye.", "3807": "Aye.", "3808": "Aye.", "3809": "Aye.", "3810": "Is that everyone?", "3811": "Miss Clemmons, I didn't hear you.", "3812": "I think she's at the center, right?", "3813": "Yes, she's there. So I'm not sure if she's going to be-", "3814": "Engaging...", "3815": "... as much.", "3816": "Okay. [crosstalk 00:03:38]. Is that okay?", "3817": "Yeah, that's fine.", "3818": "Okay. Perfect, perfect. So, we're going to proceed with introductions. So, we're going to start off with everyone sharing their first name or pseudo name. In addition, I would like for everyone to share a little bit of background about themselves. So, who you are, where you live, and what you do... and share a value that is important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today.", "3819": "So, I can start first. My name is Kelly. I oversee our Grand Street Settlement Brooklyn Youth Programs. Background about me... I work in Brooklyn, but I rep the Bronx. That's my neighborhood. And a value that matters to me today specifically, I would say, is... helping. It resonates with me a lot. During this time, I've been getting lots of help from my parents when it comes to helping me with my son, who's special needs.", "3820": "And also, I've received a lot of help from my team, to keep doing the work that has to get done to support the communities that we service. And I don't think that I would be able to wake up every day and have the drive that I have to keep pushing forward during these times if I didn't have excellent people on my team just being amazing. So, helping one another is something that I cherish a lot.", "3821": "So, anyone can go next.", "3822": "I'll go next. I'm Eva. I am the Site Director at Grand Street Settlement Bushwick Cornerstone Community Center. And one thing that I value is honesty. I believe that no matter how harsh it is or how good it is, I'd rather have all the information up-front in order to make the necessary changes that need to happen, should anything happen. So, that would be my word.", "3823": "I'll go next. I'm sure I'm ChaRon. I am the program director at Grand Street Settlement, Tompkins Cornerstone Community Center. And something that I value is consistency... I feel like being consistent is a very big importance in our life. Regardless if it's at work, regardless if it's friendships, relationships, family, I feel like being consistent is one of the most important things that we can value and the things that we can do.", "3824": "If we're consistent in life, we can continue to do whatever it is we want to do. If we're consistently working hard, if we're consistently putting our best foot forward, if we're consistently helping people, I feel like we'll always benefit. And as long as you're consistent, you can get whatever it is you want done.", "3825": "Thank you. Don't forget to rep your community.", "3826": "Oh, I'm in the Tompkins Community, but I'm actually from Bed-Stu.", "3827": "Oh wait. That's perfect, that's perfect! It's the same community.", "3828": "Yeah, I don't live in Tompkins though. Sorry.", "3829": "She's too funny. Hi.", "3830": "Hello, Welcome.", "3831": "Hi, I'm Sandra. And I'm the MEC from Bushwick Houses. Bushwick Projects' the best MAP development in all 15 map facilities that they have. Bushwick is number one. We have an amazing director there, Miss Eva, forever ever.", "3832": "And what we value or what I value the most is respect. I give it and I warrant it. Thank you.", "3833": "Did we freeze?", "3834": "No.", "3835": "Okay, there we go.", "3836": "Okay. It was wonderful hearing about everybody. I was over here smiling and laughing, listening to everyone introduce themselves. I feel so honored to be around such beautiful people in this Zoom meeting.", "3837": "So I'm Ceedah, Sister Ceedah they call me. I can rep many hats, but today I am going to represent Bushwick Houses as a MAP participant. I am a part of the resident MAP program... And we work really hard in Bushwick Houses. We really do, we work really hard. I'm trying to remember... Oh. So, being a part of the MAP program, I'm a stakeholder as a resident. So, we call ourselves stakeholders. And I was invited by my MEC, Miss Sandra Tapia. And I'm so happy that she invited me.", "3838": "One thing I value... Oh my goodness. So many things to think... I will be soft and say... more soft than my softer side, and say compassion, to be compassionate. I think that's something that I'm learning through all that we're going through, because I'm usually very like a lioness. But now, I'm learning to be compassionate. I'm learning, and it's a beautiful thing. And I think that if we can have more compassion towards other people, no matter what... what's your gender, your nationality, your status, your economic status, your political affiliation, whatever. Your education, background... whoever you are, anybody. Just to have that compassion for one another is very, very important.", "3839": "That's beautiful, thank you. I'm not sure if Miss Clemmons can hear us. [crosstalk 00:10:30]-", "3840": "Did she come on and say hello?", "3841": "She was here first. She was actually just trying to call me right now.", "3842": "She's probably busy. Do you want to text her or something? I know she would have wanted to participate.", "3843": "Let's see. Maybe she can join us for one of our next questions. Yule?", "3844": "Yes. Hi.", "3845": "Will you be answering questions with us, or should we skip over?", "3846": "No, I'll be here just for tech support.", "3847": "Got it, thank you. Okay.", "3848": "No problem.", "3849": "Thank you. All right, thank you ladies. All wonderful words during this time, and just in life as well. It's very important. Honesty, compassion, consistency, respect...", "3850": "Hello? Hello?", "3851": "Hi. Hi, Miss Clemmons.", "3852": "Oh, okay. Hi, hi. Sorry.", "3853": "It's okay. It's okay, we understand. So, we were going around introducing one another, and the ask was for you to say your name, what community do you represent, and then sharing what you do. And then, one word that is important to you and relates to what brought you to this conversation today.", "3854": "Oh, boy. I'm [inaudible] Clemmons. I'm a tenant of Bushwick, member of the NSTAT team, the TA treasurer... I represent Bushwick, Bushwick Houses... The one word, loyalty.", "3855": "Thank you, for sharing.", "3856": "Yeah. Hi, everybody.", "3857": "Hi.", "3858": "Thank you.", "3859": "Okay.", "3860": "We're going to go on to the next question. And the next thing we want to do is invite you to share a little bit about yourself, and because we're talking about health and well-being, today we're going to invite you to take a couple of minutes to share about your personal health story and what wellness looks like for you.", "3861": "So the question is, think of a time, place or story, where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at the time? How did you feel?", "3862": "And I can start first. Remembering a time when I felt at my best was right before I had my son, almost four years ago. I was meal-prepping, I was working at a school that had no elevators, six floors, up and down the stairs all day long, looking for kids, tracking attendance, talking to teachers... I didn't have to go to the gym. I was at my best weight. And just mentally too, I had a great team. I loved my job.", "3863": "I still love my job, but at that time I was still doing direct service, and I was very hands on with families and kids. I'm not a social worker, but I felt like I was doing therapy with kids and even marriage counseling with parents, and I just love to be able to support people. So mentally, I felt very good because my mission is to help people.", "3864": "And the factors that contributed to my wellness at the time was of course, the eating, the physical fitness, going up and down the stairs, but then also I felt very close to God. I was paying attention to challenges that I was having. I was looking to God to get guidance and clarity, and... I guess it was setting me up for how it was going to be after having a child. And I tell people, there's a pre-baby Kelly and a post-baby Kelly, and pre-baby, I was very... I reacted out of rage instead of reflecting and being calm and process...", "3865": "And I was transitioning into motherhood, and I didn't realize it. Now that I'm talking to you guys, I'm realizing it. I was already transitioning into my motherhood phase, where now I'm more calm. I think about the facts. I'm more objective about my decision-making, and I guess that time, being well physically mentally, spiritually, helped set me up for a great pregnancy.", "3866": "So Eva put the order in the chat, and that's the order we're going to follow for the question. So thank you, Eva.", "3867": "Okay. So for me, I think I would say right now. Why is because before, I was always so on the go. I would do this, I would do a million things at one time, but I wouldn't necessarily take the time to focus on myself. So [inaudible] now, I work out more, even if it's at home. I'll go to the park and I'll work out in the park...", "3868": "I take my time now. Like Kelly, I don't react right away with rage. I take the time, sit down, and think, \"How can it affect me in the long run?\" And also, I got closer to God as well. I pray every morning, every night, and not necessarily just for the things that I don't have, but the things that I do have and being thankful.", "3869": "So, even though we're going through a pandemic right now, I see the plus side where it allowed me to be more in tuned with myself. So, the factors would just be... the time of everything being still, that allowed me to focus on Eva, and not Eva and 20 000 things. So that would be it for me. So ChaRon, you can go next.", "3870": "For me, I would say, between... my four years in college, because I was super-duper active, and I literally did everything that I wanted to do. I was president of every single club, I was captain of the dance team. I had like a 3.75 GPA. I was really tearing it up back then. Also, I was at the best weight. I weighed more than I weigh now, but I was [inaudible 00:17:00]. It was great.", "3871": "But also, another time would probably be... I want to say like August, September, when I first transitioned from being a AD to a PD. I felt like at that time I was really... Not that I'm not focused now, but it was a different type of focus. It was like, I finally felt like I reached a place that I wanted to be, that I was happy that I got to, and I wanted to make sure that I maintained that and I kept that.", "3872": "So, it was me learning, me evolving, me really taking all the things I learned in Bushwick and then applying them here at Tompkins. So for me, that was a really good time because I feel like now... I'm cool at Tompkins. I got it, but at that time it was really a moment of me learning myself again, and taking all the things that I learned from before and applying it now. So how can the things that Kelly, Tiffany, Eva taught me at Bushwick really work into Tompkins? And I felt like that was a really great place for me, because I wanted to be a PD. I was saying I wanted to be a PD, and then I finally became that PD.", "3873": "So that was... a good place for me. And I think it was the factors of me just being consistent again, and then reaching that goal that I wanted to reach. And it was also... making sure that I was getting to the center and working on days that I didn't have to work, just to make sure I could prepare for a time like this.", "3874": "Thank you, ChaRon. Can we have Sandra next? Sandra, are you there?", "3875": "Oh, I'm sorry. Absolutely. I'm sorry.", "3876": "It's okay.", "3877": "Okay, so... when I've been at my best, right? And health-wise, you said... Okay... I want to say [inaudible 00:19:04]... before this. And I think that over these 90 days or 80-something that we've been quarantined... I was quarantined from the very beginning. In addition to working with Bushwick and living in Bushwick, I work on Rikers Island. I have all CMC cases. I'm a social worker, so I deal with all court-monitored cases.", "3878": "So, I was quarantined on March 13 because of Harvey Weinstein. That was my client. So he tested positive, so therefore I had to become self-quarantined. Everything was fine... thank God. But I was at my best before then, because I was so sure of everything. Right now, we're living in these uncertain times that... I pray a lot. I always have, but you don't know from one minute to the next.", "3879": "So my health is good, thank God... I mean, I'm a little crazy but I think everybody is, right? So, I think before this pandemic. And I'm just ready for this to be over and everybody to be fine, and for us to move forward. Yeah.", "3880": "Thank you. Can I have Miss [Clay 00:20:21]?", "3881": "Yeah... You said what we were supposed to do again? Say a time when we were-", "3882": "Think of a time, place or story where you felt you were at your best, in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, and what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? How did you feel?", "3883": "Health and wellness, remember a time.... Okay, well I don't know. There's too many. I'm going to talk about now, the here and now. Is that okay?", "3884": "Yeah.", "3885": "I'm remembering the here and the right now, and here and now, what I do for health and wellness is I dance. Every Saturday, I put my house music on. It starts at 6:00. So from 6:00 to 9:00 PM, I'm dancing and I'm going in, right here in my house. It's my health and wellness...", "3886": "Of course, all the people that know me know that I'm very spiritual and I pray. It's part of my way of life. However, outside of that, I love to dance. And dancing is something that brings me happiness. It keeps me healthy, it's part of my wellness... It's part of my spiritual wellness. Psychologically, I can just dance and feel the music and just... It's not an escape. It just makes me feel good. I feel so much better. I don't feel stressed... I can talk with the children, and go to work with a very positive attitude. Dancing is therapeutic.", "3887": "Thank you. That's beautiful.", "3888": "[inaudible 00:22:26].", "3889": "Miss Clements, are you... on? Miss Clements?", "3890": "It's okay. We can go to the next question, and then if she's able to join, we can ask. So, thank you all for sharing.", "3891": "I think that what resonated to me from hearing all of your answers is that you felt your best self when you were doing something for yourself, right? Miss Clay dancing, blasting that music that feeds your soul. Sandra, putting on pause and just taking care of your health, worrying about yourself. Eva, getting in that workout. ChaRon, doing the most least mode, right? Doing for yourself, doing what makes you happy. Same thing for me, when I was working. It was hard work, but I was happy. I was doing what I loved. So, that's something that I found to be a common thread in hearing your stories.", "3892": "So, the next question we're going to be focusing on is more looking into your community. So, I'm going to ask a question that looks into the hopes for your community that you have, and the health concerns that you have for your community. So, we're going to invite you to think about community broadly. It could be Bushwick, it could be Tompkins, it could be a borough, it could be the whole city. Whatever comes to mind for you, we want you to think about.", "3893": "But the question is, what in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Share stories from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better. So, I will repeat it again. What in your communities is working well to support your health and well-being, and what are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being?", "3894": "And I'll start. I shared this before. I'm from the Bronx, and the Bronx is the most under-resourced borough [inaudible 00:24:41]. So it's very hard for me to think about health and wellness things that exist in the Bronx... but what I was able to think about was my other community, Brooklyn, and our programs, and how our programs serve as hubs for people's wellness. For example, Bushwick being open six days a week for food pantry... That is contributing to people's wellness and that's positive. Tompkins being open twice a week for food pantry and five days a week for grab and go meals... That's supporting the communities we serve in a positive way, because there is a need in both of those communities.", "3895": "In addition to that, I think about when our communities go into crisis. And unfortunately we experience violence, but our community centers are hubs for people to meet, to start the healing. So, I see that as something positive that comes out of negativity, but that our centers can be those supporting [inaudible] to grieve and to talk about next steps, and to plan together. Especially you all, who are part of the MAP team, that's what you guys do. You rally around one another to support your community. So that's one thing I can say, when I think about the work that we do. I definitely look at my centers as cases of health and wellness and positivity...", "3896": "For me, I live in Harlem but I feel like I'm never in Harlem because I'm always in Brooklyn at work. So like Kelly, I consider Bushwick as my community as well and my place is of course the community center, just because I'm there every day and I see what goes on. [inaudible] to provide food for the community, and actually it makes me happy, especially when it comes to like things that we may take for granted. Other people don't have it, so when I see people [inaudible] the community center and they walk away with a smile on their faces, that goes a very long way.", "3897": "And it makes me feel good as well because, let's say I may not want a jar of peanut butter, but the person who came to the community center needed it. And now, you're able to provide for your family. That makes me very happy, and it's honestly one of the reasons why I do the work that I do right now. So, that would be my experience... just working out of the community center and providing those resources to Bushwick residents and more.", "3898": "I walked away, so I'm assuming the question... I had to use the bathroom. The question was... What was the question, real quick?", "3899": "What in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand a little bit better.", "3900": "Okay, perfect. So, I am from Bed-Stu. I currently live on the borderline of Bed-Stu and Crown Heights. It's a weird area. It's like Atlantic, so it's literally the place that cuts off both areas. But so, for me in Bed-Stu, the community center has definitely been a place of health and wellness, and I've noticed it for the community because I've seen just what the food pantry does, and our grab and go meal distribution.", "3901": "So, when we started our grab and go meal distribution, I wasn't sure the success that we would have. The reason that I say this is because of... The Tompkins community is a little tricky at times, and it's hard to get them to do things that they don't want to do, and which... I feel like that's in any community, but there were a lot of people that were eager and wanted to come to the grab and go distribution, whether it was just to grab meals for themselves or was to grab meals for those four or five kids that they have in their household now.", "3902": "And even though we were only able to provide a meal, it was still fulfilling for me to see all of those people there, just those people who come in every single day. And now when I talk to my supervisors, they tell me that we have regulars. They know who's coming every single day, who's going to take those 30 meals that we have every single day. So, I know that for at least 30 families, I'm providing something efficient for them every day.", "3903": "When we originally had our first food pantry, we posted the flier a day before. I happened to be in North Carolina at the time, but my supervisor sent me a picture and it was literally... Te line was wrapped around the center. It was crazy. And just knowing that we have that many families that can hear about something and then want to come to that place, and really are being helped in some type of way... And we're not just giving them... Again, it's not like the grab and go where we're giving them a meal. We're actually giving them food that they can use for possibly a week. They get canned goods, sometimes they get hygiene products, they get fresh produce...", "3904": "For me, that's the biggest part because I feel like being at Cornerstone, being in the community center, other than helping out after school participants, the biggest thing is, what do we do to help the community? How do we really give back to them? Because I feel like at times, our children are our most important aspect, but then we have to realize that we are [inaudible] the community. So how do we give back to them? How do we make them feel welcome? How do we make them feel good about this?", "3905": "And then I think also, our wellness checks that we've been doing... I've been doing wellness checks on our parents, because I have a really good relationship with most of them. And just hearing them say, \"Thank you, Miss [ChaRon 00:30:15], for calling me today,\" or, \"Thank you, Miss ChaRon, for just reaching out and letting me know what's going on...\" It's good for me and it's good for them, because I know maybe, possibly I made their day a little bit better, just with them hearing from me or just us having that conversation, or just someone being able to vent for those five, 10 minutes about what their kid did for that day, or how they didn't do their homework or whatever the case may be.", "3906": "So, it's those little innuendoes that we have, that we're going through, that we're dealing with right now, that really... makes me happy for the community. It makes me happy in what we're doing at work.", "3907": "Thank you, ChaRon.", "3908": "Well for me, in the Bushwick community... I've been in that community... I'm not going to say the date, because you guys probably weren't even born yet. However, I've been in there for quite some time and Bushwick is multifaceted. Eva, as we all know, does an amazing job with the children. We have programs to address all populations. We have a senior program, we have that Disengage program that the Week Against Violence is in charge of, and NSTAT team, we try to engage all families. We do have an amazing NSTAT team.", "3909": "And the most thing I love about Bushwick is that... we may be at each other's throats. And I say that literally, because I'm a resident there... and we go at it. But when things happen, we pull together. You can walk into Bushwick and you'll swear that I am best friends with everybody, when I know 75% of them don't agree with my tactics, but they'll roll with me just to make Bushwick look good. You understand?", "3910": "That's camaraderie, that's community, that's togetherness. Through this whole pandemic, we never stopped. We never stopped. I don't know what happened in other MAP sites, but this MEC has been on the ground running since March 13, that she was quarantined from one, to service the community. Then thank god, Eva and them are doing the damn thing because I'm tired. So she tapped me out, and I appreciate honestly, that now she could confess to it!", "3911": "Grand Street took over. You don't see it the [inaudible 00:32:41]. You don't see MAP, because y'all doctors. Y'all good. We are now promoting a virtual graduation that Eva is also helping me, with for the community of Bushwick [inaudible] and surrounding, because I don't know of your pantry or if you guys know... Bushwick Pantry doesn't only service Bushwick residents. Our lines go... My God. Just like ChaRon's, but lord. Our lines... easy, we service 300 plus, easy. On any given day, from east New York... [inaudible 00:33:15].", "3912": "I said, \"Okay, no problem.\" I mean, all over. We work on 206. I've gotten people from 112... I'm like, \"Okay, fine.\" And here come Eva with the boxes, the giant boxes, giving it to people. They'll come with a shopping cart. We carry it to the car. We do so many things... [inaudible] but it makes me happy to see them leave, Eva. Happy, smiling... And I'm grateful that they didn't suffer, because a lot of people suffered through this. And Bushwick residents have not, and I'm grateful for that. Thank you.", "3913": "Thank you.", "3914": "Miss Clay, you're on mute.", "3915": "Miss Sandra, I say...", "3916": "[crosstalk 00:34:07]!", "3917": "That's what I say to you, Miss Sandra, because you are a real trooper, for real. She's telling no lies, for real. So again... I love Miss Sandra. She's been in my life since I was a little girl. Could you imagine that? I don't want to tell your age, Miss Sandra.", "3918": "It's okay. I will be 5-8 in August, and loving it. I'm proud of it.", "3919": "So, since I was a little girl, I remember Miss Sandra. So... in our community, again, the wonderful food pantry there... It started with the NSTAT and the TA, and then it just expanded and got bigger. And now, we are really doing the collaboration that we really always did all alone. And so it's extended to the community center, and it's better because it went from something small, and as we continue to work together, it grew and grew. And it's continuing to grow and develop, and it's a beautiful thing because they're servicing the community... with something very essential, which is food. We all need that. That's something that's a necessity.", "3920": "On the other hand, as a resident of Bushwick, as an NSTAT member, as a stakeholder, as a mother... I'm here as a resident and I also utilize some of the things that Bushwick is doing. One of the things I would like to highlight is the New York City CONNECT with Miss Daralee V\u00e1zquez. She held women empowerment circles for us every week, and Miss Tapia knows. We in the circle, we talk about solidarity and space, what does it mean to heal... She has these amazing PowerPoint presentations. She really helps us to identify a lot of our weaknesses, as well as our strengths as women, as mothers, as community advocates and [inaudible 00:36:30].", "3921": "And [inaudible] the fact that that is another form of healing that we are being exposed to and that we're getting here at Bushwick Houses, along with our brothers. They have male empowerment. I don't know what's going on there, but I'm sure it's just as amazing. Big up to Miss Daralee Vazquez. She is the truth. She has helped me really reflect within myself to think about a lot of things with the riots, with... even before it happened. She was on it with Ahmaud Arbery. She was on it. And right after we talked about him, then came George Floyd.", "3922": "So, she kind of prepared us to not, something like what you ladies are saying, be so reactionary. So now, we're not so reactionary anymore. We're reflecting before we react. So, that's what's going on.", "3923": "Thank you, Miss Clay. Miss Clemmons...", "3924": "All right, thank you. Yeah. Our programs, the work that you guys all do to support stakeholders, is essential to keeping a community thriving. And that leads into my next question. What are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better. So, I'll repeat the question again. What are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand?", "3925": "Something that I'm learning about... My family is a community, and I knew it before but... helping one another, and tapping into one another in times of need and crisis is important. And I know people tell me, mom's, like, \"Oh, well when somebody says they're going to help you, accept the help.\" 100% facts, ChaRon and Eva, when somebody is going to tell you they can help you when you become a mom, take it. [crosstalk 00:38:54].", "3926": "During this time, I value it 100% more. My parents are older, they are ill... They're not able to go outside. But even then, I was able to take my son to them so they can help me continue to work. And I know that's not only my case, that many families have done that during this time, that many families have had to merge households with parents and their children and their grandchildren, to live together to support one another during this time.", "3927": "And that's something that resonates a lot for me, because sometimes as kids, you take your parents for granted, and or your grandparents. And this time has allowed me to have even newfound appreciation for my parents, because of all the support that they are still able to provide me, going through this crisis and their health issues. So Eva, you're next.", "3928": "For me, I would say... help as well, but more in a sense where... For example, I came across an experience where I didn't think... You when you have friends, you may not speak to them every day on a consistent basis but when you need the person, they're there for you. That's something that I learned especially during this pandemic, or with the riots that's going on. You may not see everyone working together on an everyday basis, but when the time is needed, everyone comes together without even having to say, \"I need your help.\"", "3929": "And also, acknowledging that if you need help, it's okay to say, \"I need help.\" Kelly know this. ChaRon knows it as well. I can be drowning and I'd rather do everything on my own, as opposed to asking for help. But now, with all the time that I've been reflecting with myself, it's way easier to say, \"Hey, I need help.\" And then now I have the help, and now I can do the other things that I wanted to do, as opposed to still being stuck with item number one.", "3930": "So, I've definitely learned that about the community, that even though we may not be all together every single day, when the time is needed, everyone shows up.", "3931": "I think I can say alongside help, it would be appreciation and togetherness. The reason why I say appreciation is because during this time, I've really noticed that our parents, as well as our... even participants, are really appreciative of the work that we are putting in, of the fact that we are making the wellness calls or the fact that we are doing grab and go, the fact that we are doing the pantry, that we are giving out our arts and craft supplies and our mad science supplies to the kids... The fact that we are trying, the fact that we are trying to do our Google Meets and things that we have with our kids, our video conferences... They are appreciative of these things.", "3932": "So it's really nice to know that, and it's really great to feel that from the community... Feeling that sense of appreciation from the community is amazing for me as a program director, because then it shows that all the hard work that we've been trying to do, and I'm sure Eva can attest to this... All the hard work that we are putting in or the things that we are trying to do are benefiting the community, and they're happy with the things that we're doing.", "3933": "And then I think it's also... When I say togetherness, literally... People are so helpful, I feel, now as opposed to before. They're showing that they're in this together, like we are a community. We are... And then when I say togetherness also, I mean the whole aspect of the Black Lives Matter protests and movement that are going on. Really seeing communities come together and standing up for something that they believe in... People have been super duper nice to me.", "3934": "I mean, yes, white people have been extra nice, but even just black people have been... and Spanish people and brown people have been really, really nice to me, just because we see that we are in this together, and that we see that we are alike and we do look alike and we are going through the same struggles, and that we should be nicer to one another and that we should work together to get to whatever goal we're trying to get to. So I think that whole togetherness, the appreciation, and the helpful aspect is what's really prominent in my community right now.", "3935": "[inaudible 00:43:47].", "3936": "It's my turn? I apologize. You guys [inaudible] share with you. I'm actually in New Jersey doing a virtual wedding, but we almost finished. Okay...", "3937": "I feel like ChaRon... ChaRon's another one. She's another one of my girls, but she traded us and went to Tompkins because she wasn't Bushwick, but I still love her. At any rate... I feel that Bushwick, although we are able to pull together, there's still a divide. And I'm going to turn my camera on because I want y'all to see how sincere I am with this. There's a divide in our community that must be addressed.", "3938": "And it bothers me, but I believe... Because I'm not a quitter, and I'm going to go forth with it. I believe that, with all this going on in the world, with all these protests of Black Lives Matter, which they do... And if you see my little logo, I have a black son, so yes. Absolutely, they matter. However, everybody's life in Bushwick to me matters: black, brown, yellow, blue, Asian, I don't care. But there is a divide that I'm going to fix before I leave this position. Thank you.", "3939": "Thank you.", "3940": "Okay, Miss Sandra... I was all happy with ChaRon's story. She made me feel optimistic.", "3941": "I'm sorry. You are very-", "3942": "[crosstalk] so optimistic. Oh man, I was loving what she was saying about togetherness and the unity and everything...", "3943": "But that is our ultimate goal [crosstalk 00:45:50]... And you can help me get there.", "3944": "I'm always the devil's advocate, but I'm not to be the devil's advocate. I'm going to stay on the positive note because there are good things to see, right? And I feel you. I'm not dismissing what you presented, Miss Sandra. I heard you. I feel you. There's a divide. You're right. It is.", "3945": "And I appreciate your dedication to wanting to make sure that we dismantle it. I really do. So, I don't want you to think I'm being dismissive about what you contributed and shared with us.", "3946": "Thank you, honey. Thank you very, very much.", "3947": "I really mean it, but I'm going to stay on the the positive vibe that Miss ChaRon brought with this togetherness... because it's important for us to get into the mindset of togetherness. And I don't think... I think that everything everybody said is valuable. It really is, and I want to learn how to be together. I want to learn that. That's something I have to learn, and I'm willing to learn it.", "3948": "Thank you... So, thank you ladies for sharing. Sandra, I validate what you've said as well. Oftentimes in communities where there's people who live there for a long time, they get to see the transformation that takes place. They get to see how communities transform, and get to see, as we're living in the United States, how some things stay the same that need to change. And that's exactly what Sandra's tapping into.", "3949": "But I do believe that, in this experience, like you said Sandra, we do this work to service all, and that is evident in the people that are coming to Bushwick from east New York... and the kids that we service, right? They're from everywhere, from all types of backgrounds, from all experiences, different types of household structures, and we're just there to service them regardless of any of it. So, I do think it's important to address the challenges, and then also continuing to push forward so people can get to that point of togetherness.", "3950": "So thank you for sharing, everyone.", "3951": "No, absolutely. Bushwick is my passion, and if you go on the Bushwick Houses page, you see. I'm the narrator behind that page. Bushwick is my passion, Bushwick has great potential, and Bushwick has intelligent children. Do you know that one of my children... and the mother is going to get upset with me, but one of my children got accepted to Morehouse?", "3952": "Beautiful.", "3953": "Do you understand that? That's the type of things that we need to be magnifying. Do you understand? That's why I decided to do this virtual graduation. And now, I just got an email from [inaudible] that the governor has said we could have a ceremony of 150 or less, with social distancing. So, I'm putting an email together right now because I want that baseball field open. I'm going to get white chairs... I'm doing it up for my kids in Bushwick.", "3954": "Sandra...", "3955": "That's wonderful. That's wonderful.", "3956": "Oh my god [crosstalk 00:49:38].", "3957": "Thank you.", "3958": "Can't wait to come to the graduation.", "3959": "That's going to be beautiful. [crosstalk 00:49:42].", "3960": "June 30th, June 30th!", "3961": "Very nice.", "3962": "Kelly?", "3963": "Yes.", "3964": "ChaRon, is this the young lady that used to work at the center with you [inaudible 00:49:55]?", "3965": "Yeah, that's me.", "3966": "Okay! [inaudible 00:50:01].", "3967": "I know exactly who you are, mom. I know exactly-", "3968": "Oh, yeah! They like you. They was like, \"She was fun and down to earth.\" That's what my son said.", "3969": "Excellent.", "3970": "Down to earth...", "3971": "So, thank you ladies for sharing. Yule, do you have the audio to share now?", "3972": "I do. Would you like me to share it?", "3973": "Yes. So, I'm going to give a little introduction to it. So, we're going to hear an audio, and I want you all to imagine as if that person was talking to us now in this meeting. And then after the audio, I want you all to share some feedback and insight on how that audio made you feel. What did you think about? And we'll go around again, sharing our thoughts [inaudible 00:50:51].", "3974": "We can't hear it.", "3975": "Sorry. I was muted. I'll play it.", "3976": "Okay.", "3977": "Well, it's not specifically that she's been sharing with me. She talks to her friends on the phone and I overhear it. She talks about how she has to share a gown with... her coworkers. She talks about how she needs to reuse a mask. She talks about that she has to work with five patients a day. So, that means that she's really within [inaudible 00:51:43]... She's being exposed to a lot of people with the virus.", "3978": "And that scares me, because not only is she my family, but she has a high chance of getting that virus because she's overexposed to it. And she has to share a gown? That makes no sense... I don't know how to explain this. If she catches the virus and something happens, I don't know if it's going to seem mild, moderate, or... severe. I just don't want it to happen. That's all I have to say.", "3979": "For a bit more context, that was [Ahman] from [inaudible 00:52:37], who's mom is a nurse. And just he's explaining his feelings on the situation.", "3980": "Thank you, Yule. So after hearing that... What are some things that come to mind, after hearing this young man share his experience and worries right now?", "3981": "Where's Hunts Point? The Bronx?", "3982": "Yes.", "3983": "What type of community is that?", "3984": "Usually, back in the '80s... a high area for crack epidemics, prostitution, drug sales, and things of that nature. But right now, they cleaned it up. They did an amazing job with it.", "3985": "Oh... and his mother is a nurse, and this is what he's feeling? I'm a little desensitized. So when I hear about death and virus, and people that's going through trauma and stuff... because I'm a little desensitized, I might seem hard, but I can... feel something for him because that's his mother. That's his mother, who's sharing the gown that [crosstalk 00:54:02]?", "3986": "Yeah.", "3987": "Yeah, so he's thinking about, \"What if my mother dies? What am I going to do?\" Basically... And then you also look at other aspects like, why are they sharing gowns and masks in New York City hospitals? What's going on with that picture? Where's the money? So, you think about that too.", "3988": "But I think what really had me drawn was his tone, and just his uncertainty about what he was going to do if he lost his mother to the virus. It resonates. It makes me feel something for him, like you feel bad. I feel bad he has to go through that. It's like you're seeing through someone else's lens, outside of your own... what someone else could be going through. Yeah.", "3989": "[crosstalk 00:55:11]... [inaudible 00:55:12].", "3990": "I think that for me, it's like... Yes, he's one person, but I think, how many more other stories are just like him? And the help that he needs, not even physically, also with mental health, that's something that... People struggle with it right now, and people are not open to receiving that type of help that they need. And then even how Miss Clay said, \"Okay, what's going on with New York City hospitals? Why is it that nurses are having to share PPE?\"", "3991": "And then that even brought back to me being thankful for my organization: the fact that, before we even opened to give out food, they made sure that we are equipped, that we are safe. And that made me realize, not a lot of people have the same luxury. And just thinking about the services that... I don't know if he's a child or he's a young adult or an adult, but just thinking about the services that he may need, and what the family is going to need as well, should it all go south. So, those were the immediate thoughts that I had.", "3992": "I agree... I agree with everything that's being said. I have to add that I heard fear, uncertainty and... fear of being alone. A mother portrays a certain image for a child. A mother fixes everything. So there you have his mother, who he feels can fix everything, in need of assistance. Then you have the sharing of these PPE, but this is the reality. And then look at the community that they're servicing.", "3993": "You will not see this in Manhattan. And this is where we have to move forward as a community, to receive the same treatment and respect in Bushwick that the Hasidics received. The Hasidics had a whole funeral during this pandemic... a parade up and down Union or wherever the heck they are. Nobody was pushed, touched, stepped on, kneed on, none of that.", "3994": "And this is when my passion... It goes on overload because we know, if anybody on this call or in the world can't see the systemic racism and the savage inequalities that they do to certain communities... Latinos and African American communities, the Bronx, Hunts Point, Bushwick, Bed-Stu... and if we can't come together... See, right now is a good time because we got their attention. We have the government, the world's attention.", "3995": "Right now, we're supposed to move forward and continue with the demands. I'm not saying looting. I'm not saying breaking. None of that, but continuing with the demands. I was on another Zoom call before this [inaudible] job and they said, \"[inaudible 00:58:33] but you always defending...\" Yeah, I am. I am, because what... \"Oh, but the looting, that's not legal.\" I said, \"And neither is murdering when you're policing. That's not legal either.\" I'm not justifying it, but we have to meet at a middle and really fix the fear in people.", "3996": "The mental health needs to be addressed. I've always said that for Bushwick. Domestic violence... All these things, but you can put a program in place... Me, per se, because I am a facilitator as well, to where you're going to hold the panel where y'all going to be talking amongst each other and you're not addressing the needs of the community. I could do 50 million programs like that. You have to address the community, not sit there and give each other accolades.", "3997": "I'm sorry if I went on a rant. I apologize.", "3998": "Thank you. I'm sorry. I lost connection, and then I had to turn off my video so I can hear you guys, but I'm glad-", "3999": "I'm glad. So, go ahead. Move it forward. Next.", "4000": "Thank you, thank you. Something I wanted to say when I first heard this audio... I thought, \"Okay, Hunts Point. Black or brown kid. Teenager.\" You could hear in his voice... and with the climate of what we're going through right now, this kid not only has to probably worry about his mom and her health, but he already has to worry about what's going to happen to him when he goes out in the street. And that made me really sad.", "4001": "So, it just speaks about our young people in New York City and the disparities that exist, and the multiple worries they have to carry on their shoulders that are very different than a kid that's not from a black and brown community.", "4002": "Yeah. I mean, when I heard this audio just now, recently... I actually read a story. I don't know if it was this exact same story, but I heard a story closely related to this, in which a young man was expressing his concern with the fact that his mother has to share PPE as she's working in the hospital, and the things of that sort. And it made me think of a lot of things.", "4003": "It made me think of, one, if I was in that position or that predicament, what would I do? And I think about the fact that I have resources, and I feel like I have enough resources that I could figure out a way that I could do something better for my mother in this situation, or even the people in her facility that she's working at. Because I do work for Grand Street, we probably would have figured out a way to get some gowns and some masks to my mom.", "4004": "But the fact that people in the community, or people in any community, don't have these resources or don't know where to get these resources from, is the part that saddens me. And it also saddens me that he's stuck in this predicament, and that we that live in America are stuck in this predicament, because we're supposed to be considered one of the richest countries in the world, and yada yada yada, and all this other stuff. But yet, we don't have the necessities that we need in order to survive in any condition, whether it's a pandemic, whether we're not in a pandemic... because then we also deal with poverty, and we deal with food hunger and things of that nature.", "4005": "So, it really made me think of the fact that we lack these resources. And it sucks that we have to deal with the fact that we lack these resources, and that we don't know what to do.", "4006": "Thank you, ChaRon, for sharing that. So, let's think about a New York City that would be healthy... What would [inaudible] New York City where everyone can be healthy look like, and would it feel like to you? What comes to mind when you hear that?", "4007": "For me, I think about food, and people having good quality food options. Produce that's fresh, that lasts a long time, that... the businesses that are in the areas have multiple options for people's needs. That's the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to health for me. It just starts from what we eat, when we intake.", "4008": "And then, I think about medical facilities and health care. And I've been thinking about this a lot because I've been working with people who are in medical school. And I think about the responsibility that black and brown medical professionals have to carry on their shoulders, because there's so few... There's a lot, but there's few in comparison to others, and how... It's a relief. They say it's a relief for their black and brown patients when they enter a room, because somebody understands them. Somebody gets their background, gets their culture... especially even with mental health providers too... where black and brown people are not the majority doing the mental health work. And when people are able to find people that look like them, that understand them, that walk into a room... there's a relief that comes with that.", "4009": "So when I think about health, I just think about more representation and more access to healthier options.", "4010": "For me, I would also agree with the food... just because, if you look at how certain communities are made up, like for example in Bushwick, you see the McDonald's. You see the Burger King, you see Taco Bell... You see all these fast food restaurants, but it's hard to find like a juice bar. Now, there's one... but that's just there now. It's new. You don't see a lot of... businesses that promote for health and wellness. As opposed to if you go to Park Slope, in that area, you see all these types of organic places.", "4011": "So, definitely with food and just the same way with mental health clinics... Having more programs that's focused for the disengaged youth as well, to provide them with the resources so that they won't have to resort to the gang violence or whatever it is that they believe is the way out. So, that's my opinion on how I believe New York City would be better, in addition with education. That is the number one thing. We need to educate our kids in order for them to excel. So, finding ways for healthy foods to become more available, and increasing or bettering education and mental health services within communities.", "4012": "I definitely can agree with both of you guys with the education, the food, the mental health, but for... I would think also housing. I think housing is a very big problem in New York City, and just in general, the conditions that people are living in, especially our community members. And I'm sure Eva can again attest to this, because we've seen this or we've heard about it, or parents have spoken to us about it, or just community members have said the condition that they live in is... Excuse my language, damn near poverty.", "4013": "It's horrible that they have to live in these conditions, and it's horrible that people are stuck having to pay this ridiculous amount of rent and then live in these conditions. You're talking about infestations with different rodents, you're talking about mold, you're talking about... just so many different hazards that they are living in.", "4014": "And then outside of housing, I think you want to talk about... What I would like to see is progressiveness or growth within the community, and what I mean by that is, in the communities that we serve, and I'll use Bushwick, for instance. In Bushwick, the community, that area, you have Graham Avenue. Graham Avenue has a supermarket, Graham Avenue has a bank, it has a urgent care... It has all of the type of stores that you need to go to. A shoe store, a clothing store, any type of store you need to go to. Got a jewelry store, all of these things. And the reason being, is so that they can keep our type of people within these communities.", "4015": "And I think an order for our people to ever better themselves is to get them out of these communities, so they can expand, so they can grow, so they can go to different places, so they can understand different things, so they can meet different people and they can grow to be better. And I think it's kind of like confinement, I guess you would call it, because if you give someone something and you put it in an area that it's close to, it's easier for you to just go there as opposed to expanding your horizon. So, I think progressiveness and growth within the communities, and housing is something that would definitely contribute to making NYC better.", "4016": "You're on mute.", "4017": "Where did Miss Sandra go? I can't hear you.", "4018": "She had to leave.", "4019": "Oh, she didn't say? She said, \"I have to leave\"?", "4020": "Yeah. She said it. She sat down on the chat.", "4021": "Oh... I see the chat right here, but I don't see her saying it. Sandra... Okay. \"I have to go.\" Oh, okay. I see it now.", "4022": "Okay, what does a healthy New York City look like, you said? Wow... A healthy New York City to me looks like equality... equality. I'm not going to just say just within the community in itself, but equality... That's what it looks like, a healthy New York City.", "4023": "So basic social equality... I think we're learning a lot from the social equality that we're seeking, wanting to have certain liberties in terms of our social aspects, interacting with other people, wanting to be respected socially, going to eat where we want, sit where we want... a lot of different things. Be able to tell a woman to tie her dog up if we want, sit on a bench and the west side neighborhood if we want... Things like that, social equality. Going to stores without being disrespected and followed around like you're going to steal... just a lot of different...", "4024": "Social equality in terms of housing, yes. We're in poor, horrendous conditions, but thank God we have a roof over our heads. So yeah, social equality could be on many levels, when it comes to food, shelter and clothing... Yes. We need all of the basics, but I'm thinking more of progressiveness in terms of political equality, economic equality. We need to have those things as well. Understanding policies and different laws that affect us, because ignorance of the law is no excuse. You have the RAD program. That's still going to be in effect. As far as policies are concerned in terms of NYCHA, the residents in which we serve, we need to educate them and inform them about those policies so they prepare themselves.", "4025": "Education... I've worked as an educator, and it's very hard. My primary job as an educator and primary position as an educator is to educate my children. I am their first teacher, and I'm rough. I'm rough all the way around. I'm a diamond in the rough. You know where you get a diamond from? In the bottom, in the core of the earth, and it doesn't look all pretty and bling bling like we usually see it. We are all diamonds in the rough. We in the belly of the beast. We in New York City.", "4026": "So, equality is going to come on many, many levels. Eva, I know for sure, we're going to see that GED program, right?", "4027": "[crosstalk 01:11:41].", "4028": "That's what's up, because education is our passport. And we need that. So, we going to continue to do that work that we do, continue to reinvent ourselves, recalibrate, make sure we get ourselves and our minds together during this time in isolation, preparing. Proper preparation prevents poor progress.", "4029": "And we've got to move forward. We've got to appreciate the communities that we have, because when all is said and done, yes, many of the businesses won't make it. Economics... but we have to do what? We have to rebuild. And this time, maybe when we rebuild, we'll have more equality in how we allocate money and how we actually do business with one another... where it's all inclusive. And then we can show our children, see? Because you have to do things locally before you expand. And then you start to do things nationally, and then globally.", "4030": "So, you work within. Yes, many of our children haven't been out the perimeter of the four blocks of Bushwick Houses. Maybe if they had to go downtown in Brooklyn, maybe... However, that's why you have programs and things that we're implementing, where we do expose our students. We take them many places, to expose them, to take them out of their immediate environment, so that they can know how to conduct themselves. We give them orientation, and then... they can go.", "4031": "So, not to be continuing on and on, but yes, I would say a healthy New York City would look like equality across the board.", "4032": "Thank you for that, Miss Clay.", "4033": "No problem.", "4034": "So, next is our final question. What is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation, that you'd like other people to hear?", "4035": "For me, I would say yes, a lot is being done in the community of Bushwick. There's a lot being done, but then there's still a lot more to do. So, this conversation that we had today... Yes, I knew of the things that we already needed to do, but it just gave me more validation and more of a motivation to go ahead and just put my foot there and start to do the work, with the wonderful people who joined with us this evening. So a lot is being done, but a lot more is needed. That's what I took away from today.", "4036": "Thank you, Eva.", "4037": "I think what I'm going to share is the importance of this conversation. I think it was really healthy and it was really [inaudible] healthy conversation, but it was really great to hear the passion that other people do have for the community, and the fact that a lot of... Basically, all of our visions are aligned. We all have a clear vision for what we want to do for our communities, whether it's Tompkins or Bushwick, but we have a clear vision for what we want to do for our communities. And we know that there is ways to get there.", "4038": "So, I think having this conversation and continuing to talk about it will only push people more and more to do the work that needs to be done. So it just really heightened the importance of this conversation.", "4039": "My takeaway... I think what stood out to me was some of the things that you all said in the beginning. Being helpful, respecting value, having respect, consistency... Utilizing those characteristics as a community and pushing forward, holding our political leaders more responsible for the things that are happening in our communities... and doing the work. Really just doing the work, being about it, really being about it... Not just speaking the truth to power, but really the action, the action behind it. So that's my takeaways: remembering those values that you all explained in the beginning, and just being able to implement those values in our community in everything that we do... in everything that we do.", "4040": "But more importantly, a lot of the things that we talked about has to do with economics. It has to do with economics... straight like that. And in order for us to deal with the economics, we have to hold our political leaders responsible: our representatives, our council members, our senators, representatives... all of them. I'm getting the little fliers under my door right now. And anybody that live in NYCHA knows... Here they go.The little glamor gloss, red, white, and blue flyers.", "4041": "So I'm really like, when are we going to have this real dialogue with them, where we can really start to do the work that we need to do? Kelly, you talked about valuing your team. As a community, we're a team. And... as I said, we got work to do, but those are my takeaways.", "4042": "Thank you. I always tell my team... They always say, \"What else can I do?\" Do what do you know. Do what makes you happy. That's important. And of all of us on this call, supporting community, supporting one another, putting our best foot forward with integrity is what matters, is what I'm getting from this conversation.", "4043": "And a plug for the census... If you haven't filled out your census, do it.That matters in this work. So I hope that when you leave this call, that anyone you talk to, you make sure that they complete the census because, even more now than ever, in this pandemic, our communities are not completing the census. Ten years from now, we're not going to exist. We're not going to be counted. So, we need to make sure that all of our age groups in our communities are counted in the census, from babies to seniors, and that we continue to promote just helping one another, supporting one another, and putting our best foot forward to do what we know best.", "4044": "So, thank you all for joining this conversation. Does anyone else have anything else that they would want to share, or any questions for us? No? So as mentioned, the audio recording is going to be used to inform public policy, in journals with public officials, with the Department of Health... So you may be seeing some of this information shared, and if you would like to learn more about the Local Voices Network, you can go to LVN.org. Eva, can you put that in the chat for me? LVN.org, to learn more information. And Yule, I'm going to pass it on to you so you can share next steps.", "4045": "Okay. As you can see, the media is now being recorded. Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I've begun the recording at this time. I need to share a little information with you before we begin the conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become a part of the LVN collection, as well as the Rikers Memory Project collection. There are three main purposes of this conversation, first, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and the needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers and members of the media. To this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation.", "4046": "Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share your stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community rather than sharing any personal health information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, then added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the records available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "4047": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\"", "4048": "I agree.", "4049": "I agree.", "4050": "I agree.", "4051": "Awesome. Thank you. We want to make sure everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in the conversation and support those goals. We have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're also on the materials that we went to you in the confirmation. These are, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, share the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns, stay curious, ask questions, pause, take time for reflection. Listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that our words have an impact. And when possible, close unnecessary programs, applications and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything that you want to add or change? Okay.", "4052": "No.", "4053": "Oh, I see people nodding. All right. Just a quick bit about the Rikers Memory Project. This is a community based participatory initiative through which the collective stories about the impact of Rikers are activated to envision a more just NYC. In this spirit, the project uses storytelling, art making, oral histories and digital archiving to document and make visible the impact of Rikers. The project includes three components, an oral history collection that includes the stories of people impacted by Rikers. So far we've gathered 83 stories, with a goal of gathering 95, so we're very close to our goal. Actually, these conversations will be added to that collection, so we actually have more than 83 after today. The second is a multimedia installation that documents and makes visible the history of Rikers, activates the stories that have been collected, and helps to support a campaign to close Rikers Island. Then the last part is a public health initiative where we aim to look at the public health impact of a place like Rikers. How do we quantify the harm of Rikers? That's the Rikers Memory Project.", "4054": "My company, Create Forward, is one of the partners on this, along with Just Leadership USA and the Humanities Action Lab. The conversations that we've been doing via Zoom with LVN are going to be added to that collection. Any questions before we dive into this conversation? All right, cool. Okay. To kick us off, to hear from each of you, love for each of you to introduce yourself. Share your name, what you do and what your connection is to Rikers Island, and then a value that is important to you that you bring into this conversation. I'll just write that in the chat so everybody can see it. Who would like to start us off?", "4055": "I can go if no one else wants to.", "4056": "Oh, I was going to ...", "4057": "Go ahead, Trent.", "4058": "Go ahead, ladies first. No, ladies first. I was going to let you ... go ahead. Ladies first.", "4059": "Okay. I'm Elena. I am the director of the Bronx Freedom Fund, which is a community bail fund in the Bronx and Queens. My connection to Rikers is that I worked with people who were being held there pretrial on bail, and then spent a lot of hours there and at the boat, waiting to meet with people and waiting to pay bail. I've never myself been held there, neither have any of my loved ones. Then did you say ... oh, a value that we're bringing. For me, I guess it would be listening. I liked the description of listening generously, so I'm holding that in my mind.", "4060": "Trent, you're the next one.", "4061": "My name is Trent. Originally born in south Virginia, but live in Harlem right now. My connection with Rikers, I was there three times. What I've been through with the mental health issues, oh ... it needs more improvement, a lot more improvement because what goes on inside there ... you won't notice until you've been inside and you really know what's going on. People can tell you this and that, but you actually have to be there yourself.", "4062": "So I hope today, what we speak about, to get put towards the end, let them work on it because we need more mental health on staff. Because they're saying, \"Well, you're going to go see one,\" but you're not actually going in, not going until two or three days later. By then, anything could easily happen. But they need them right there. If an individual say, \"I need to see the medical,\" you said I have to wait. Okay. If they didn't feel like taking you, have them come see you. But it's not like that. It's very difficult. That's why so much is going on inside with those individuals dealing with mental health. For myself, it's when ... I spoke about it at a town hall meeting. I take medication right now.", "4063": "Trent, we're going to actually get into this a little bit more.", "4064": "Oh, I'm sorry. I got corny.", "4065": "That's all right.", "4066": "Okay.", "4067": "What's a value that you're bringing to this conversation?", "4068": "More improvement.", "4069": "Say that again.", "4070": "Improvement.", "4071": "Okay. Thank you. Brandon?", "4072": "All right. I'm Brandon. I work at Just Leadership as the New York campaign's coordinator. My connection to Rikers is both through my work, I've had a career as a criminal justice advocate and organizer through different organizations that have always been affiliated with the Close Rikers campaign, even before I worked at Just Leadership. Also, my family has a long history of incarceration on the island. Growing up, I had cousins who were about the same age as me who were actually all in Rikers when we were 16 years old. That was way back in the day, 2006. Then yeah, I've had different aunts and uncles who have struggled with substance use and just never really receiving the treatment or resources they needed, and their own communities being sent to Rikers, and then state and federal prisons for some of them. So this work is very important to me.", "4073": "I think one of the values I bring to it is, as being someone who's not formerly incarcerated myself, I've been able to witness the impact it has on families who are not incarcerated, but lose those connections with their loved ones. My story myself, my mother raised me by herself and moved me when I was about five years old to live upstate in a predominantly white suburb because that's where my grandparents had left to get away from our \"less desirable\" relatives who were in and out of jail and prison. I think even to this day, they regret that decision. Family is very important to all of us, but the ways the system keeps us from preserving those values and keeping families together is something that's really important to me.", "4074": "Thank you, Brandon. Again, my name is Piper. I use she or they pronouns. My connection is that I, since 2002, I have taught on the island, adolescents, bringing arts programs there for a long time, all the way until adolescents were removed from the island. So I spent a lot of time working there, and working with young people there and working with young people coming home from there. Personally, I'm a child of two parents who were formerly incarcerated, and definitely have seen the impact both in terms of physical wellbeing and mental health, and how it's affected all of us. The frame of this conversation, because we're doing it with the Department of Health, is really about health and wellbeing. It's part of the DOH's Healthy New York campaign. It was really important for us to make sure ... I think so often when we talk about a healthy NYC, we forget about people on the island. We forget about Rikers and forget that it's a part of ... the people on Rikers are also New Yorkers who deserve health and wellbeing as well. That's the framework of this conversation.", "4075": "To kick us off, we wanted to start by establishing a little bit of a baseline in terms of how we think about health and wellbeing personally. Just going to ask you to reflect right now about a time in your life when you experienced health and wellness, and what you remember about how you felt and what those factors were that contributed to that sense of wellbeing. So you might start this by saying, \"I felt healthiest in my life when blank, and then some of the things that were in place to make that possible were blank.\" Let's just go in the same order that we went in before for this one. Just finish the sentence, I felt healthiest in my life when, and the things that were in place with this.", "4076": "I felt healthiest in my life right after I graduated college and I took a 10 week road trip through the national parks out west. I think I felt very mentally healthy because I was in between two exciting things and knew what was going to happen next. I was starting to work in the Bronx a month later, and I knew that that was happening and I wasn't worried about the future. I had a place to live when I was going to move here. I was surrounded by just huge open beauty. I liked the way that I took up space in these enormous places as a tiny person, but I also felt like I had power in those moments of finishing school, entering the real world, and just being surrounded by such beauty and almost just, not desolation, but there were so few people around and so many mountains and trees and waterfalls. I felt very free and mentally healthy. Even though I was really dirty and living in a tent, physically healthy too from moving around a lot and breathing clean air.", "4077": "Thank you.", "4078": "For me, I felt healthy in life when I became independent, went out on my own. And understand when it's about paying bills, and doing things that my parents didn't have to do for me no longer. Healthy things in life is also when I was able to start traveling, going on cruises, and enjoyment that I figured I should do in life. I was the healthiest then. And when my mother and father was together before the family got seperated. But otherwise, that's it.", "4079": "Thank you.", "4080": "Okay.", "4081": "I felt the healthiest in my life when, yeah, I think when I was in college. I played a few different sports in college. I'd take for granted the fact that meals were included in my tuition and everything because of the options afforded to me. It was like, three meals a day, I knew I could rely on that. I got my education, three meals a day, and physical activity all from one institution. I think that was when I felt the healthiest in my life and felt like I had everything around me.", "4082": "Good. Great. So we heard nature, a sense of independence and self reliance, being able to take care of yourself, the opportunity to travel, connection to family, having an institution provide you with those things that you needed, such as meals and an education, and the ability to play sports and be active. Keeping that in the back of our minds in terms of the things that have made a difference for us in terms of our sense of wellbeing, we're going to think about our community members, our neighbors on Rikers Island, or those returning home from Rikers Island. What kinds of resources do you think are needed to support health and wellbeing for people returning home from Rikers? We're going to free flow with this conversation, so anybody who wants to share at any point can just jump in. I'll just put the question in the chat so you can see it.", "4083": "I think it should be job training and housing. There's a lot of individuals that leaves Rikers and they don't have no family, they're back out in society. So it should be some type of job training and housing. You place them in some type of housing where they could stay focused. That's what I think.", "4084": "Thank you.", "4085": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "4086": "I agree with that too, housing, for sure. I also think a lot of the clients that we've worked with have health insurance, like Medicaid or some other type of healthcare plan, but don't have doctors, or are not going to preventative care. I found for me, even having my company health insurance that I think has more options than Medicaid, I find it really hard and overwhelming to find providers, and would imagine it could be helpful to have maybe a healthcare advocate or someone give a list of providers that are accepting new patients. Like, a checklist of what type of doctors to go to in a year for preventative care that's covered by insurance. Yeah.", "4087": "Yeah. I think I agree with Trent on housing, or everyone on housing, and the support of knowing that you have a roof over your head and somewhere safe to sleep at night when you do come home. Yeah, I think healthcare too. Not just seeing doctors, like medical ... I know dentists are doctors, but not just seeing physical doctors, but seeing a dentist too or an optometrist, things like that. People who may have had an old glasses prescription and are literally walking around, not even seeing the world the way that they could years before when they first went into Rikers. I think those are things that we always overlook. It's like, a physical is great, but people also need to see a dentist or need to see a chiropractor. How do we connect them to resources like that, that get them paying attention to how they feel physically and how they're in tune with their body when they return home, so that can be the foundation of how they take care of themselves in our communities?", "4088": "I think, Brandon, that reminds me to include also in that list is mental health and wellbeing. How can I find either a therapist or a counselor, someone who can help me work through the trauma that I just experienced if I'm coming home? Especially low cost or free.", "4089": "Trent, you were starting to talk about mental health earlier. Are there specific things that you think would be really helpful for people coming home from Rikers?", "4090": "Getting evaluated so they know where they're at because that's very important. Then it should also be you get released, no one think you is ready to go back out, there's a place you should be able to go to where you're going to get the treatment so you can fit back into society, which is not easy being on Rikers a certain amount of time because one dollar is what? It's still a struggle when you come out if you ain't got fully the health or the mental that you need. There should be other options instead of just sending them out, putting them on medication. Because really, all the medication's doing is, it's drugging you up. You're walking around in a daze and you ain't really ready yet. You should be where you make sure that they're really ready, to know where they're going to get the right help. Because down on Rikers Island, there's no help for anyone who has mental illness. It's not. It makes it worse. It really makes it worse. So we need better treatment.", "4091": "Right, so access to community faced mental health resources.", "4092": "Yes.", "4093": "I imagine that if you don't have stable housing, then being able to focus on your mental health is nearly impossible.", "4094": "You aren't ready for where you left off from. You're going to go right back around the same people that's not going to be there to try to help you. You need to go where you get the help. That's what it mainly is, help. If it comes down to it, it's help.", "4095": "Anything else anybody want to share on this one?", "4096": "Oh, go ahead, Trent.", "4097": "I'm sorry. Go ahead.", "4098": "We keep having ideas at the same time. We're vibing. This is specific to COVID and these surrounding circumstances, but in working with a bail fund, getting people out who are medically vulnerable, just seeing how little information people are given when they're going home about both how to protect themselves and their loved ones is just completely astounding. So just making sure that people know who's most at risk, how can you mitigate risk? Maybe don't go home and stay with your grandmother, and connect someone to a hotel room or something like that, so that we're not getting everybody sick from an epicenter of the virus. And obviously, that is not the first step that should happen. It's just like, if there's a pandemic, get people out.", "4099": "They also should be tested. There's probably so many on that island that's not been tested. They find out, oh, when they ... But they should be tested too. And like she was saying, don't go near the elders if you haven't been tested. You really need to be tested, coming down to it.", "4100": "Yeah. A first thing is, when people are coming home, is having access to a COVI test before-", "4101": "Yes.", "4102": "Yeah. Cool.", "4103": "I want to add to Trent and Elena's comments around mental health resources. I think there should be ... We have systems for vouchers for everything. I think there should be vouchers for therapy too. I think that should also be extended to people's families. If you want a voucher because you're a father or a mother coming home and reuniting with your child, there should be a voucher that gets family therapy for you, your significant other, your child to all process that together, as opposed to folks thinking this is just someone just returns home after 15 years and the family can just get back to the American ideal.", "4104": "I think it would be great to think about, how do we resource people to reconnect with their families in other ways than just ... I think the NYCHA Family Reunification Program is great because it allows people an opportunity to get housing with their family again. But we're not providing them the counseling and the support that they need to make sure they keep the family together. Then that just shakes up ... if there is a split up, there is an issue in NYCHA, NYCHA's very quick to drop people, and try to evict people and get people out. So how are we protecting against that, or at least providing resources to stop the ...", "4105": "I would just add to that, more specifically, culturally responsive mental health support. As someone who's spent a lifetime accessing mental health, working with mental health practitioners, I can say not everyone has the ...", "4106": "Resource?", "4107": "Understanding of race and of culture to ... or even of incarceration and how it impacts families, to be able to offer that kind of support without it being more stigmatizing. So really culturally responsive resources, I think, is something I would just add to that. Cool. Moving onto the next question, which I'll drop in the chat, as we talk about people on Rikers Island right now, what are you learning about wellbeing and access to health support resources that you'd like others to understand?", "4108": "The people that I've spoken to who are currently on the island, like Elena said, just the lack of even knowing where to go or where information comes from on learning about what are the precautions or safety measures being taken during COVID? Or if there is an incident in the housing unit and things get completely shut down and locked down, people's visits to doctors or appointments with clinical professionals, whatever, may be canceled. How do we safeguard against that and make sure that if there's an incident with one person, it doesn't damage someone's access to health needs or support or medicine in that moment?", "4109": "Then I think also, we just saw recently, and I don't know how much of this is fabricated or not, but there's a man who attempted to escape Rikers twice in the past week, and both times, had gotten to the shore and to the water. They seized him. But when another detainee was interviewed, he had said, \"He has no choice but to run. He doesn't have a lawyer right now and the law library is closed. He can't schedule a virtual meeting with a lawyer that doesn't exist, so this guy's facing serious charges.\" The food there, they're even talking about the physical conditions of Rikers are worse than they've ever been right now during COVID. And food, the pantry that usually delivers the food and operates on Rikers is not operating as usual. Things aren't status quo for them either because they're also dealing with COVID. A lot of people are saying they're getting the same meals every day. Some blocks are reporting they're getting the same three meals during the day, bread and cheese sandwiches and milk.", "4110": "At a point, I think it's like, what would we do if we had to eat the same exact meal every day and it was this stale white bread with a slice of government cheese? I think that's going to have serious health impacts on people too when they're not getting the nutrients and the protein that they need. It's all hidden on Rikers Island. No one can see it. No one has a direct line because it's so hard to schedule these televisits, and there are no in-person visits right now. I think these are all things people need to know about. When the rest of the city is struggling with something, especially a health pandemic, Rikers Island is really struggling. People there don't have ... there's no transparency and accountability on what they're being fed, or whether or not they're getting fresh air and sunlight in the middle of the health pandemic.", "4111": "Mental health, it's strange. I'm just thinking about something. When I was on Rikers Island, I was on Rikers Island for two years fighting my case. I got close with an individual, but he only had a couple months, he'll go out. Months later, he'll come back in. I was asking him, \"What's going on?\" He said he was scared to go out in society. He felt more safe in prison. I'm like, \"Why?\" He said he didn't have nowhere to go. He said when he don't have nowhere to go, they send him to a shelter. He said being in a shelter is just like being on Rikers. He was crying out for help and he wasn't getting it, then he just started snapping.", "4112": "So, like I said, they need help with housing and evaluations because what type of person in their right mind would go out just to come back in? That's a mental problem. That was scary. It was real scary. Yeah. They need a lot of help with that mental illness. Sometimes a person won't realize they have a mental illness until they keep seeing the same pattern and they realize something is wrong with them. Yeah. I just thought about that. It's scary.", "4113": "I've heard a lot of people say, just in passing, on the internet or whatever, \"Oh, it feels like I'm locked up,\" or, \"It feels like I'm in prison during quarantine.\" It's like, good. Good for you. You should feel that way and you should recognize that there are millions of people across this whole country who have faced that for years on end. And not because the government was saying, \"This is how we protect each other,\" but because the government was saying, \"This is how we punish them. This is what they deserve.\" Now everybody's complaining. Everyone's like, \"Oh, I got to get out. I got to get some fresh air.\" Different people are trying to figure out when they can plan their next vacation. It's all these things that are ... we don't realize how much we take for granted our freedom, and how much we really neglect the freedom and mobility and access to nature that we don't provide people who are incarcerated.", "4114": "I think also, this summer in particular, I guess it's true every summer, I hear a lot from people about the pollutants. Because the hotter it is, the more people can feel the effects of being situated on a hazardous waste site on the East River. Is it okay if I also talk about the boat? Does it count as part of Rikers?", "4115": "Yeah.", "4116": "Especially there, where it's at the end of all these ... there's a bunch of dumps, and then there's a bunch of fish markets and other produce markets that are just incredibly stinky, and compounded by the fact that there's no green space over there and there's just really high levels of car pollutants. I think people are really feeling that when you're confined, and then when you go outside and it's even hard to breathe that air, that's been coming up.", "4117": "Yeah, that reminds me of just the lack of ventilation in Rikers and just how hot it gets in the summertime, especially in the heat of the summer in July or August, it's awful. Just absolutely awful. Then you've got people packed in together in these small spaces where they can't open windows and there's no way to breathe. Yeah, no, there are no AC units. In some of the CO offices, yes, but no AC units in the dorms.", "4118": "You're so right because there was individuals in there passing out, actually passing out, in the summertime. Because if it's 85 outside, it's 100 and something on the inside. Like you said, there's no circulation and you're out there with a bunch of concrete. And now you're inside, it's bad too. No circulation.", "4119": "Yeah, like 100 something degrees inside. That's a good point.", "4120": "Yes. I was in there for two years before they decided what was going on with my case.", "4121": "Yeah. Okay. Next question, just given our conversation, what would a healthy NYC where everyone, including people detained on Rikers or returning home from Rikers look like? That question's a little clunky. What would a healthy NYC look like for everyone, including people who are either detained on Rikers or returning home from Rikers?", "4122": "A healthy NYC provides the funding and resources to local communities to be able to establish their own restorative justice and accountability programs outside of law enforcement, and make sure that we're checking off every single box and figuring out every possible solution before anyone places a call to the police or any law enforcement agents. And that we're giving folks an opportunity to address violence and harm in their communities, but we have to resource that. It's not as simple as people just going out and having conversations. Often that requires space. You need space for people to come, and to process and have those conversations. You need to provide resources like food or childcare when people don't want to bring their children into those restorative justice spaces to talk about what's happening in their family to shield them from any of that trauma while they're working through it. That means feeding the kids when they're being supervised by somebody else, and paying that person who is using their time and energy to support that family.", "4123": "Also, if it means that family has to miss work, being able to provide the resources for them to be able to miss a day of work, if they're working an hourly job or anything like that, and they don't have vacation time or sick time to use to go to therapy or restorative justice programs. I think an actual infrastructure that acknowledges the billions of dollars we put into law enforcement must be divested from, or at the very least, matched by the commitments that we make to restorative justice. If NYPD gets $5 billion, then the Red Hook Community Justice Initiative and in community court also gets $5 billion, and so does the one in the Bronx, and so does the one in Jackson Heights in Queens. All of these local neighborhoods should also get the same amount of resources that law enforcement gets because that's how we actually address the root causes of violence and prevent it to be able to create the future we want to see in New York City. So I think my idea of these healthy communities is actually funding them at the scale that we fund all the punitive institutions that exist to create the problems we have now.", "4124": "Also-", "4125": "I think I want to say, through this practice, I also want to acknowledge we've made a demand of one billion dollars from NYPD, and they're still going to have $5 billion if we are successful. We need to start talking now about how next year, we're taking another billion. And how we continue to do that and don't just let it get absorbed into other existing institutions, like the Department of Education or wherever else. I'm sure there's other areas that we could cut spending in the Department of Education that would improve the outcomes in school when it comes to disciplinary actions. Like, actually funding guidance counselors that maybe aren't even fully ... they're not through the Department of Education, so they are not accountable to producing the outcomes the Department of Education wants. They're actually accountable to the outcomes that the community wants, kind of like an oversight body. I think we can move resources from many institutions, not just law enforcement, but into all of the solutions we want to see that are transformative and restorative.", "4126": "Wow. Brandon really said what I was about to say. But you know what would make a healthy NYC too? I'm talking about with the population ... they should open, for the young ones, more community centers, after school programs. Because there's a lot of parents who weren't as fortunate to have that type of money for babysitters. So some after school programs. Because it's not too many PAL Centers around like it used to be, or Boys & Girls Club. They need to open those back up. I'm speaking for myself, when I used to go to the Boys Club, it kept me out the streets. I was looking forward to, after school, going there because there was always something to do. They need to open up more things for the community for the kids that need the help.", "4127": "I would think also, the Renewable Rikers campaign deserves a place in that history of having an environmental justice lens in terms of what happens to Rikers, and how do we invest in the atmosphere and environmental wellbeing of the surrounding community? I was going to say something else too. Oh, just the barriers to entry and ... I think Trent, what you were talking about in terms of job training is super important, but so is dismantling some of the barriers to entry for employment that are statutory and not about not having training, but are about excluding and barring people who have an open case, who have a criminal record, whatever it is. Because if we want people to be able to support themselves, support their families, access all these different resources, then a lot of times, a job is important for that.", "4128": "Anything else?", "4129": "Yeah. I think, just to track it in the notes here, what we talked about before too, housing. There's no reason in a city with the wealth that New York City has, that anybody should not have a roof over their heads. The fact that we've got all this wealth, but such a wide poverty gap is really appalling. I think a healthy New York City looks like everybody having a roof over their heads too.", "4130": "We talked about housing, we talked about the need for creating infrastructure around restorative justice for people engaging in those processes, investing in neighborhoods and neighborhood resources at the same scale as we'd invest in law enforcement, after school programs, community based counseling, Renewable Rikers, the environment. All of these different social determinants of how relationship, connection, addressing the root causes of violence from a community based perspective rather than using law enforcement as a response. What would need to change right now in order for us to have those things?", "4131": "I think one of the most difficult things is reckoning with that, there needs to be a bold transformation and deconstruction period right now where the infrastructure of our city is not designed to make a healthy NYC for everyone. The infrastructure as it is now is designed to preserve the status quo and protect the haves. I think one of the things is, there needs to be a massive deconstruction. That means a lot of things that people think that they need, or that they want or that they're worried about ... There's been conversations in the past that I've been a witness of at community board meetings, talking about new public housing developments and people saying, \"Oh. Well, no, this public housing development already has so many problems. NYCHA's not handling it well here. How are they going to handle it well there?\"", "4132": "Then it's like, well, yeah. If that's true, are we just going to shut down the construction of 3000 new apartments that could be affordable for families in Brownsville? Or are we going to hold NYCHA accountable to fixing the problems they have now and making sure that we never get back to having these problems? Because I think there's always a hesitancy of ... We've even heard it around the borough-based jail plan with Rikers. It's like, you're going to build it and it's just going to recreate what currently exists. Well, that's why we have to destroy what currently exists and build something completely new and significant, with a scale and capacity that's significantly reduced, because that's part of the deconstruction period. We've got to demolish and deconstruct all of this. But what is built in this place, it really does matter. And it cannot resemble anything that's here right now.", "4133": "I think the same goes with NYPD. In order for this healthy NYC to exist, we've going to completely abolish NYPD as it is and figure out what are the solutions, what are the alternatives that we set in place? District attorneys, former police officers, people in affluent neighborhoods, are going to be afraid of what it means when we no longer prosecute people for civil offenses, or no longer prosecute people for jumping turnstiles or marijuana possession, even if marijuana is not fully legalized. If we're declining to prosecute all these things, there's going to be the fearmongers out there. But New York City has to boldly step into this period of deconstruction to completely abolish the systems we currently have.", "4134": "That was great. I think a part of that is having the political will and the pressure to do everything that Brandon said. I also think in terms of shaping what comes next is making sure that people who are coming home from Rikers and their loved ones have a seat at the table, and not just a pro forma seat at the table, but are actively involved in shaping what things look like. Not, \"Oh, we have an advisory group of people,\" but really, this is driven by people that are experiencing it.", "4135": "Awesome.", "4136": "I just want to say something if that's okay.", "4137": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "4138": "I just came home from doing 16 and a half years. The first two months was ... As she was saying, I went and filled out an application for a job. They had said, \"Have you ever been convicted? When and what?\" But I put it. The manager's like, \"Well, do you think you changed your life around?\" I was like, \"Yeah, I said I'm going to get a job.\" He's like, \"If I give you two weeks, but I'll train without pay, do you think you'd be able to do it?\" I said, \"Yeah,\" because that's how bad I wanted to show him that I'm willing to work. I wind up getting the job. Now all of a sudden, he's like, \"Well, I'm going to help you, but making money is what's going to help you.\" So right now, I work in a nursing home, St. Mary's Nursing Home. That's where I work at right now. He saw that I wanted to work. Yeah.", "4139": "So it could be done too, it's up to you. It's about the individuals giving you a chance, that's what it comes down to. Because everyone that goes to prison is not what the interviews ... what they think they are. As for myself, I copped up to something I didn't do because I was tired of seeing my mother coming back and forth to court, back and forth, back and forth. I said, you know what? I've got to stop thinking about myself. I had to think about her too because she was going to go with me through ... if I'd have went to trial, she was willing to be there. I seen the tiredness, the tiredness, the tiredness, so I copped out. But I know I went for something I didn't do. They know the person, they know who did it. All they wanted was that conviction. And I took it. That speaks about this so much. Up to today, it still hurts. It's something that's just ... Oh man, but I'm home now and I'm happy about it. Yes.", "4140": "Thank you for sharing that.", "4141": "Okay. I'm thinking, but just getting teared up because 16 years of my life was gone for something I didn't do. I had to take the time for something I didn't do, and that hurted. They denied care. They knew it wasn't me, they just wanted that conviction so they could close the case. It hurt. That messed my life up. I didn't get a chance at these jobs, I've never been to one job. I don't know what I'd have been doing. It hurts when you know you didn't do something, you have to take time for something you didn't do. Every day I'm in pain behind it. It just hurts. There's so many brothers I met upstate, wind up coming back down, case got overturned after 20 something years, found out the DA did something that ... It was all over the news that time. And it's wrong. It's wrong. It's our color complexion. It's sad, I'm just being honest. I'm sorry about that. I just had to get that out.", "4142": "You don't need to apologize. Thank you for sharing that.", "4143": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "4144": "We're going to move onto, we're getting close to the end, there's just a couple more questions. Really, just two more questions. Just given what we're talking about, and especially what Trent just shared, what's one thing you'd like your local representative to know?", "4145": "I would let them know stop ... so quick in trying to convict someone for something they didn't do because you just want to close the case. That needs to stop. It really does. It really does, it's so sad. It's sad. Once their case is closed, they're all right. They go, \"Okay, we move onto another one.\" All they want is a conviction. That's what they all want. They all work together. For me, that's what I went through. Stop jumping the gun and thinking this person did something, until you finally really find out that's some convicted person ... No. That's how I felt.", "4146": "I want my personal representatives on the Upper West Side to know that their district is implicated in everything that goes on in Rikers Island. I don't want them to feel like, \"Oh, this is a mostly white, mostly affluent neighborhood,\" or whatever. Like, \"That's not our problem, that's a Brooklyn problem, that's a Bronx problem.\" But to know that even if there are lower rates of people being arrested and prosecuted in places like the Upper West Side, that it's being done in our name and that everybody should be outraged. If there was a higher surveillance police presence here the way there is in other neighborhoods, it would look exactly the same. That's one.", "4147": "Then I think for my representatives of my office in the Bronx, to know that there's this false dichotomy between who deserves to get free and who doesn't. I feel like a lot of the political and institutional support that we got as a bail fund was from people who felt like, \"Oh, you're bailing out people who jumped the turnstile, people who had joint on them.\" I want them to understand we're bailing people out who are presumed innocent and who are in jail for not having money. And that regardless of the charge, that's something that should be entitled to everybody. That I want them also to reckon with what happens when something violent or harmful did occur, and to learn about how incarceration is not healing anybody, it's not solving anything. It doesn't require anyone to be accountable, or to say that they're sorry or to repair harm.", "4148": "Brandon, is there anything you would like to add?", "4149": "I'd say, yeah, the major thing that always sticks out to me is, my member here in Bed-Stuy, Alicka Ampry-Samuels, she had actually voted against the borough-based-plan, even though we have one of the juvenile detention facilities in our neighborhood too. It was because she felt like the plan, it cost too much money. I think the biggest thing for me is, yeah, this whole period of transformation and revolution is going to cost money because we have to recognize that nobody is disposable. And the fact that we're sinking billions of dollars every year into punitive agencies, but shy away from spending money to improve the conditions of confinement, or improve the accesses to resources, or family and loved ones for people that are incarcerated.", "4150": "No one would ever bat an eyelash if we spend six billion on a college campus, right? But when we're talking about building new facilities for people who are currently rotting in almost 100 year old facilities now, it's just alarming that people think that people aren't deserving of that money and that amount of money, even though we've spent trillions of dollars incarcerating this nation anyway. I challenge people to ask yourself, what are you really saying when you're saying we should not spend this much money on these investments?", "4151": "In terms of ... I'm wondering if there are things that you think, in terms of promoting the health and supporting the health and wellbeing of incarcerated people, formerly incarcerated people, are there any things that you've seen that have been working really well that you think should be built upon, or really invested in more?", "4152": "You mean as far as existing programs that are happening?", "4153": "Yeah, existing programs or strategies. Doesn't have to be in New York City, it can be other places.", "4154": "I think one program that's great is the JISH housing, Justice Involved Supportive Housing, J-I-S-H. While it can be improved, it is something that has been able to be expanded steadily over recent years. We're still waiting for a commitment on expanding it even further this year. But it gets to the root of, people don't just need to be released to the streets or released to a shelter. People need to be released with a stable housing opportunity and connection to a case manager or a case worker who can support them and, \"What do you need? What are your appointments that you would like to get lined up?\" And support them in that way. I think that needs to be something that we ... something that is just across the board that everyone ... It's just a right. When you are released from detention or incarceration, it is just a legal mandate that the city has to provide this opportunity, and not just the 1000 people who qualify for it or who have the recommendation to get into it.", "4155": "They also need, for individuals, males and females that's coming from out of Rikers Island or upstate that's not used to dressing, where they could go and there'd be someone who could teach the young man how to dress and how to present himself. If he goes on a job interview, how to speak. Don't come with a swag, speak presentable. Show them that you want to work. Take the street mentality thinking out your mind, and have a mind that you want to get back into society.", "4156": "In the last three months during COVID, I don't know if the city's paying for this or if someone else is, but the bail fund was coordinating with the Movement for Black Lives to get people to hotel rooms, giving them transportation and getting them a room for however long they needed. That would be cool if it extended beyond COVID, if we conceded that it's not only during a pandemic that people should have a roof over their heads.", "4157": "Yeah. The city is paying for it, but they're paying through service providers, like Exodus, who already do housing programs. They've given them the money, and then essentially telling them, \"Now these people are your responsibility.\" So I agree with you, it needs to be continued, but in a way that's not just the government shirking accountability and being like, \"Oh, community based organization that's been trying to release people. Now we've released thousands of people. Here's some money, put them in a hotel.\"", "4158": "Yeah. How do we use that as a starting place for a longer term solution? While people are in that hotel, being able to have a case manager, working with them to find long term permanent housing, and access to healthcare and other resources as well. So that when their stay at that hotel is over, they're moving directly into a more permanent situation. Great. We're going to start to wrap up. Is there anything else that you want to share? Any final thoughts before we close out?", "4159": "Yes. I think I'm excited about the products that come out of the Public Memory Project and all the narrative work that you've all been doing and leading. I think one important thing that I'm seeing now, and just sits with me and makes me ... I just get overwhelmed and anxiety and anger, and also sadness, is just as we see the conversations from people about following black leadership and investing in black led organizations, we're still in a moment, and I'm reminded every day, last year we were in a moment where people are not ready to follow black leadership or black led organizations when those black leaders have been convicted and proven guilty. Often times, we even see in the narrative of, whether it was Michael Brown, trying to justify why a teenager was murdered in the street, or it was George Floyd, trying to justify why a man could cry for air and be choked to death-", "4160": "Michael Brooks getting shot in the back two times.", "4161": "Yeah. It's all these things of, well, what did they do? Were they guilty? Were they not guilty? We're still hearing this narrative of, if you were guilty, you deserve anything and everything that happens to you. If you are not guilty, then maybe we should cream for you and cry for you and follow your leadership. But I think one thing I would really like to come out of this narrative project is people really actually listening to people who may have been labeled as guilty. Folks like Trent who were labeled guilty-", "4162": "As for me, I was already saved ... I'm sorry, Brandon.", "4163": "Yeah, labeled as guilty and were innocent. But yeah, how do we actually destroy that narrative or that instinct for people to see a story or see a tragedy, and ask if someone was guilty or not as opposed to are they still human?", "4164": "Yeah. One of the things that, as we're having this conversation, it makes me think about the fact that in other cities around the country, institutional racism, systemic racism has been ... by health departments and other parts of the country and of the cities, has been defined as a public health crisis. I think that everything that we're talking about in this conversation really speaks to the fact that systemic racism in New York City is a public health crisis. The Department of Health should absolutely treat it that way, and be thinking about what are the interdisciplinary approaches, the collective impact approaches that address all the things that y'all are talking about? Because it's not just one lane. It's not just health classes or mental health or health services, but it's intersectional. Really thinking about the social determinants of health, which include housing and economic opportunity and all the things that we're talking about, community based prevention of violence.", "4165": "Yeah. I just want to thank you all for everything that you've shared, and being so candid and offering some real important ... putting a critical lens on this idea of how we build a healthy NYC that includes people who are detained on Rikers and are coming home from Rikers Island. Thank you all-", "4166": "Thank you.", "4167": "For your contributions. We're going to have one more of these conversations next week, next ... What's the date? I want to say it's next Tuesday. Yeah, next Tuesday at 6:00 PM. If you know of anyone who you think should be a part of this conversation and share their perspective on this topic, please invite them and let us know. We can send them an invitation to be a part of this. Is there a poll or something that we need to do to close out?", "4168": "This conversation is being recorded. And I just want to say welcome again to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you so much for agreeing to participate.", "4169": "As you just heard, I've begun recording at this time, and I need to just share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded, so you don't have to worry about what you look like on camera. All of that is going away. We will be keeping the audio, and that will become part of the LVN collection.", "4170": "There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policy makers, and members of the media.", "4171": "To this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation. The Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health wellbeing of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information, and only sharing at any point, what you feel comfortable sharing of course.", "4172": "This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants, and partners in the project at Cortico discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "4173": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator at the Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation, and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper, or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public.", "4174": "If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree. And we each have to say, I agree, this is officially us signing off, and saying it's okay that our voices are being recorded. So I'll start by saying I agree and I'll just pass it over to Sarah. So Sarah has to say, I agree now.", "4175": "I agree. And I'll pass it over to Jazmin.", "4176": "I agree. Heather.", "4177": "And, Jazmin, can you pass it to Heather?", "4178": "I thought I did. Sorry, Heather. Can you say, I agree.", "4179": "I heard Peather. I agree. And I pass to Latasha.", "4180": "I agree. And I will pass it to Kendall.", "4181": "I agree. And I'll pass it to Taqiya.", "4182": "I agree.", "4183": "Great. Thank you all. The final thing I'll say is, we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and to learn from others in this conversation. And to support those goals, we have just a few guidelines for this conversation. They're also in the materials that we'll send as follow up, so you'll have them.", "4184": "But number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns. Number four, stay curious, ask honest questions. Number five, pause, take time for reflection. Silence is not our enemy. Number six, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And number seven, when possible ...", "4185": "I'm just admitting this next person into the conversation. Sorry for the break. Lanesha. Lanesha, welcome to the conversation. I will have to read the rights language again super quickly. It's just one paragraph. And she's gone. So maybe she'll come back. When she comes back, I'll read it at the end. That's totally fine.", "4186": "But the final thing is, please, just close any unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent.", "4187": "And now, I'm done speaking and going through all of that stuff that I need to read to you. It's super important, that needed to get done at the beginning. And now I'm going to pass it over to Sarah to guide you in this conversation. Thank you all so much for being here. I'm going to turn off my camera now.", "4188": "(silence).", "4189": "Sarah, are you at your computer?", "4190": "It's frozen.", "4191": "Yeah, she does look frozen.", "4192": "She does look frozen. Sarah, are you frozen?", "4193": "Okay. If Sarah is frozen, I will begin. Sarah, last chance to unfreeze. Okay, okay. Excuse me. I'm now on a double screen today, so I'm going to be looking around. So I'm sorry if I'm looking strange. So, Alex, thank you for taking care of all the logistics for us, and reading through all those pieces.", "4194": "Okay. So we're going to use a modified circle process, where each person will take a turn. Normally, when you're sitting next to each other, we can just go in a row. But for Zoom squares, everyone's all over the place, so we'll use a modified circle process. I can put the order in the chat that I'm thinking, and I'll transition us from one person to the next. You can pass if you don't want to talk, or you can ask someone to come back to you, if you also just want to wait a moment.", "4195": "So we already put our name and our neighborhood in the chat. So, we'd like to hear a little bit of a background about who you are, where you live, or what you do, and the value that is important to you, and how it's related to why you're here today.", "4196": "So I'll model that. And that is, so I'm Jazmin, I already said that. And I work at SIPCW. I do behavioral health stuff. A value that is important to me and brings me here today is justice. That's been on my mind a lot given recent things that are happening, but also things that have been happening for hundreds of years. So, that's the value that I'm bringing into the room right now, is justice.", "4197": "And, Heather, if you don't mind, I'm going to pass it to you, and I'm going to put the modifier round in the chat.", "4198": "Oh, great.", "4199": "Are you okay, Heather, to start? Okay.", "4200": "Yeah. I'm just waiting to see that. You want me to wait or you want me-", "4201": "But you're first, no. So you're first, so just your name, what brings you here, and what a value is that you have that you're bringing today?", "4202": "Okay. So my name is Heather. And I'm here today because I'm very interested in talking about issues regarding, not only justice, but also equality, issues regarding education, and issues regarding self-actualization.", "4203": "And what I value is people understanding who they are, which I think is an undervalued quality. But I would say that a lot of people have a difficult time really understanding who they are, which makes it difficult for them to understand who other people are. So I value having a very clear understanding of who you are. And I'm going to pass it to Latasha.", "4204": "So I threw it in the chat, I'm sorry. Heather, Latasha, Taqiya, and then Kendall. And again, if you want to pass, that's totally fine, but that's just our modified order if that's okay.", "4205": "Hi everyone. So my name is Latasha [Speller 00:09:11]. I live in Shore Acres. For anyone that's not familiar, it's I guess the closest intersection you might know, might be near Tompkins and Islands, closer to the Expressway over there. I grew up in Meyer's Corner, near Wagner High School. I am from Staten Island. I work at the Staten Island Justice Center. I am a program manager of Project Reset.", "4206": "And I'm here today because I realized I want more involvement in the community. I want to hear what's going on, what's being done. Even working with the participants, and the clients at SIJC, when we refer them out to different agencies, maybe they need employment or education, I want to know what's going on. I want to hear from other CDOs and the discussions, how can we make the community better? And, again, also justice with everything that's going on, and people who I work for, justice is big as well. I believe I'll pass it now to Taqiya.", "4207": "Taqiya, just briefly before you begin, and thank you both for sharing that, it looks like Lanesha has joined us. And I know that we have to go through the, briefly, the paragraph about agreeing to being recorded, and what the conversation is going to be used for.", "4208": "Yes, Ma'am. I think-", "4209": "So I can read it really quickly. And I'm sorry for others who have had to listen to this already. But, Lanesha, I'll just read it for you. And if you agree, I'm just going to ask you to say, I agree.", "4210": "Yes, Ma'am-", "4211": "So just to let you know, this conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants, and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "4212": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities, and in the media, then improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation, and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper, or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please share only what you were comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree.", "4213": "I agree.", "4214": "Great. Thank you.", "4215": "Thanks so much. Taqiya, I believe you were talking about your values. I'm so sorry to have butted into the circle there.", "4216": "Can everyone hear me? Okay. Hi everyone. My name is Taqiya. Everyone calls me T. Currently, I'm a student at Metropolitan College, Downtown Manhattan. I major as healthcare administration. I used to live on Staten Island, and now I live in Brooklyn, so I travel back and forth. And I'm here to be informed, and get some ideas from you guys, and I guess share my ideas also.", "4217": "And what I value is education. I see that there are a lot of people in our neighborhoods that are misinformed, or uneducated, or just ignorant to certain things that we have access to, or maybe the lack of having access to. So that's just basically it.", "4218": "Thank you, T. Up next is Kendall, and then we'll go to Lanesha.", "4219": "Good evening, everyone. My name is Kendall Speller. I'm from Staten Island. Grew up in Mariners Harbor, now live in Short Acres, Rosebank Area. Professionally, I work for the State Department of Labor in the commissioner's office. I'm a special assistant workforce development. That's basically what my focus is, is workforce development, and pretty much anything relating to employment services for job seekers and business advancement.", "4220": "Reason I'm on here, I joined this call is, just me being involved in anything I can do in relation to events in the community.", "4221": "Thank you, Kendall. Lanesha, do you want to go? Tell us who you are, where you're from, and the value that you're bringing into the room with you today?", "4222": "It looks like Lanesha was driving, so I'm not sure how the service is working over there. So, Sarah, I'm going to pass it back to you if that's-", "4223": "Thank you so much, Jazmin. And I apologize for those technical difficulties that we all experienced a little bit earlier. Okay, awesome. So moving right along, this is great.", "4224": "So then the next thing that we would like to do is to invite everyone to share a little bit about yourself. So since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to really take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing looks like, and feels like to you. So let's think about a time, or place, or story where you felt that you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. Well, what can you remember about why you felt this way, what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness, and how exactly did you feel? And I'll pass it to Heather.", "4225": "Oh, great. Okay. So I guess I need to describe who I am from a professional standpoint. So I run non-profit called H.E.A.L.T.H For Youths. And we work with about 4,000 students per year. We're a service provider for other nonprofits, so we partner with about 52 nonprofits throughout New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. In addition to that, I'm an assistant professor at Long Island University, and also I have appointments at Columbia University and St. John's. And I'm also the director of Long Island University's Honors College. I'm a pretty busy person, I guess, [inaudible] like going on.", "4226": "You know what's interesting is, the healthiest I've ever been in terms of doing healthy things for myself is right now. So every day ... Now the reason why I described what I'm doing, it's just because I've a lot going on. And so, normally, I get home between 9 or 10 o'clock at night because I teach classes on campus. I live in Queens, but I [inaudible] in Long Island, I also teach at Columbia, physically teach there. I also teaches at St. John's, I physically teach there. So I can often be on the train, or on a bus. 246 is my favorite bus. So everybody's got their favorite bus, that's my favorite bus. So I'm on buses a lot, I'm on trains a lot, I'm on ferries a lot. I travel a lot to get from campus to campus.", "4227": "So by the time I get home, it's usually about 11 o'clock at night in normal life. And while I would like to start exercising, and doing squats, and doing other things, I'm pretty tired, so I usually just go to sleep. But in COVID times, I am home and I teach. And so tonight, for example, when we get done with this session, I'm going to go walk. I walk every day now, three miles, at least once a day, sometimes twice a day. I drink 72 ounces of water a day, every day. And I'm cooking my own food, and so I cook basically all vegetables, some meat, some seafood, but basically my ratio of, of vegetables to anything else is 3:1.", "4228": "And so I would actually say, interesting enough, my healthiest life is right now, just because I'm able to be present, and in the moment with that. And so, it's fabulous, and awesome, and great. And I plan to continue a lot of this as much as I can in the post-COVID era.", "4229": "Thank you so much, Heather, for sharing that.", "4230": "I'd like to pass it to the next person. Jazmin, is that Latasha?", "4231": "It's Latasha. Yes, if you're open too, Latasha.", "4232": "Yes. I don't mind sharing. And I commend you, Heather. I wish I could say this was my healthiest, and I was taking better care of myself. But when I think about it, the healthiest for me, and I'm not that old, I'm 31, but when I say younger, when I was probably in my early 20s, I was going to the gym twice a day, I watched what I ate, I ate a lot of salad. I still drink water. I like water, I prefer water. I drink a lot of water, but back then it's was only water, vegetables, no salt. I was on top of it. And it just felt better. But, of course, I was getting better sleep. I was young, so I was living at home at the time. I didn't have stress of bills and life.", "4233": "And here I am now, 31, and I have two kids. I have a 6-year-old and I have a 10-month-old. And then now, it's probably the worst feeling. It's like, I know we're at home, and I actually have a workout machines that I look at every day, and I tell myself, \"I'm going to get on you.\" I tell my husband, \"I'm going to do it.\" And it's just ...", "4234": "Working from home is really stressful. It just feels so stressful. It's hard to separate the two, because it's like, all right, I'm doing all my Zoom calls, all my meetings, everything is being done from home. Even when five o'clock hit, it's like, okay, well I still hear my work phone going off, why are people sending me emails, why are people still on Slack? And let me just turn the phone off. And I don't know, I'm trying to do everything at once and still having ... I'm so happy tomorrow's the last day of school, trying to do the homeschool thing with a six-year-old, and we have the 10-month-old, and he's right here, not sitting still, trying to be a daycare provider.", "4235": "So I feel like now I'm probably at my worst, even though we cook now three times a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner. Not that we eat bad, but we don't eat the best either. Being up late, going to bed. And then we eat dinner usually around 5:00, I find myself being hungry again at 11:00. And I'm just like, all right, willpower, don't eat. No, I go eat. So now I'm going to sleep on a full stomach, and I know that's not good. So I feel like now it's probably one of the worst times for me. I don't step on the scale because I'm scared, but I can feel it, I know I'm adding weight. I don't feel good about myself.", "4236": "But now like I said that school's over, it probably won't be as stressful, maybe I could be more motivated, now we're like any ... from working from home in the beginning it was stressful, it's still stressful, but like I said, we're in the group, and I now got to get up, I got to do this, hop on this call, do this. It's more of slow, so I think I can feel a little bit better trying to add this to my routine. And I prefer working out in the morning. I just don't get up. I tell myself, I'll get up 7:00, I could work out for at least 45 minutes, take a shower, then we start the day. And if I don't work out in the morning, I will not do it after work. I'm just too drained after work. I have to cook dinner, there's the kids, everything just feels like a lot.", "4237": "So my best, probably 10 years ago, early 20s, 20, 21, 22. And I'm trying to get back there somehow. Listening to Heather, I was like, you know what, I can do this. It's all about willpower. I want to do it, I just need to plan. So that's my story. I'm finished.", "4238": "Thank you so much for sharing, Latasha. I do have a question for you. You said that around 10 years ago, your early 20s is when you felt that healthiest. Like what type of supports do you think really helped you feel that way?", "4239": "Oh my God, being young and living at home I didn't have to worry about ... I worked, but at the time I was in school, I was at school at the time for my undergrad, and I was working part time. I worked at [inaudible] at the time. I didn't have kids. That's probably the number one factor. I could do what I want, as I pleased. That's probably the number one thing.", "4240": "I think that it's just feeling drained. I know, like I said, I have the machine here, when I first got it, my husband got it for me for my birthday, that was back in January, I did good for the first month or two. And then as I fell off, it's when we started working from home. And I think that's what it is, is I just, I don't know ... You would think I work out more because it's here, I'm at home, but I just don't. Even now, if I know I'm not going to bed until 11:00, I can work out before I go to bed. I just don't have the motivation.", "4241": "I think age. Like I said, I'm not that old, but I really feel like I just feel different than when I was 20 compared to now. I don't know. I think age also plays a factor.", "4242": "I have a quick question. Are we able to engage with the other participants?", "4243": "We are, but we are asking that people wait, I think until the next question, just so we can get everyone to do their introductions, and talk about their value. And then on the next question, yes. But we absolutely want people to engage.", "4244": "Because I have a burning question for Latasha and a comment that ... I'm not that great, so I have a comment and a question, but I will wait. I'll put myself on mute.", "4245": "Thank you so much, Heather. And, Latasha, thank you so much for sharing that with us.", "4246": "You're welcome.", "4247": "Kendall, I'd like to pass it to you.", "4248": "Hello?", "4249": "Yes. Hi, Kendall.", "4250": "Hi. Yeah. So, for me, health, pretty much means it's a mental, physical, and social great condition all around. So I like to think that I'm living in my best form of health. But then thinking about the current situation, like the pandemic, I realized my social health is definitely taking huge hits, and I'm not pretty much participating in anything social, obviously. But I know I do feel the stress of that.", "4251": "Then in terms of thinking of what was my peak and my best wellbeing, every time I thought I was in it, I feel like I did better. So I guess that's a part of me just growing and becoming more mature.", "4252": "But in regards to the hit I'm taking socially, I was the kind of person even in my professional work, I'm wearing a suit 90% of the time I walk out my door. I'm going to multiple, like at least eight events a week. I'm working evenings, I'm working very early in the morning. I'm traveling to every borough, [inaudible 00:24:53], I'm always moving, always moving.", "4253": "Well, with the pandemic, it definitely slowed me down a whole lot, but it did allow me to appreciate what I had, and what I'm going to have, and what I plan on having again. So, mentally, it's like a struggle right now. Physically, I feel like I'm fine, no stress in there. And overall, I feel like it will get better socially. So I was like, I'm just hanging on to it in a sense, just trying to get through.", "4254": "I think the most stressful factor right now is work. Like I said, for the department of labor, although I'm a workforce development specialist, I'm not involved in unemployment, and for the pandemic they need to be. So that's pretty much been my every day workday from whenever I wake up until about seven o'clock every night, and just handling unemployment questions, and trying to get people the money that they need to survive. And then hearing all of the very sad stories, some even more like sad stories than others, it starts to get to you, well, to me. And I'm trying to manage.", "4255": "I feel like when this pandemic is over, is going to be a relief, but at the same time, it's going to always be in my mind at where we were, and where my neighbors were, and friends and family were at, and hoping that everybody can stand up again, because the thought of, some of the things I can't obviously disclose, some of the things that I've heard, it was very sad, and has me praying for the individual that I don't even know.", "4256": "Besides social and mental, like I said, physically, I think I'm all right. But I still plan, I do want to work out again. I want to be back in the shape of I would like run a marathon. Not the New York City, maybe the Stent Island one, a smaller one, but I would love to run the marathon. So something I would love to do, but it's all about me having to try to find time to do it. These little things like, well, things like that makes me want to just get up and go, keep moving forward.", "4257": "Thank you so much, Kendall, for sharing that. I'm going to pass it to, I believe, Taqiya is next.", "4258": "Well, I think right now, currently, I'm kind of in that happy phase in my life. I think I go through a lot of transitions to [inaudible] here. I am a mom. My oldest is 10, my youngest is 5. I'm 34. And I just try to take every day at a time. I'm on a health journey.", "4259": "I mean, just a little bit, it's a stigma, where they say that when you're a mother, you're supposed to be a supermom. So right now I'm fighting a supermom thing, where people feel you have to work a full-time job, take care of your children, and especially being a single mom, take care of your children, making sure they're all right, you're all right. Sometimes you're not all right.", "4260": "So being that I don't work a full-time job, I do, do hair, so I travel to client's houses and I braid their hair, and we go back and forth, and we talk about things that, or issues that bother them. These are women, so we all have the same struggle. And a lot of it is just a reflection upon you think that you're the only one going through it and you're not. And when you start voicing it and talking about it, you start recognizing these things that are coming up or reoccurring things. So how can you change this?", "4261": "So right now, in my life, I'm just trying to figure out, well, how can I change this? What can I change it about it? But also trying to be a good or a great mom at the same time. And every day, I just try to take a little bit of time to myself, to focus on what I like. Because once your kids, your children start going to school, you're left with yourself. It's sort of like being in a marriage also, once your children's saw going off and doing the things they life, you have to reinvent yourself, you have to find the things or new things, find hobbies, or just reinventing, or just coming back into yourself. So right now, being that my five-year-old's getting ready to start Head Start in August, that's what I'm kind of focusing on. That's it for me.", "4262": "Thank you so much, Taqiya. And what I'm hearing you say is the support that makes you, or the resources that make you feel your healthiest is when you are interacting with other people, and you're sharing stories?", "4263": "Yes.", "4264": "Oh, that's amazing. Awesome. So I am going to pass to, I believe Lanesha is next.", "4265": "Hi guys, hi ladies, hi everyone. I want to say everyone, I appreciate your stories. Ms., I want to say it right, I think Latasha Speller, I definitely wanted to chime in a couple of times, because I am also a mom. I have six in total, three that I birthed, a six-year-old, a three-year-old, and a two-month-old. But also I have custody of my sister and brother, my brother is 15, and my sister's 12, and then my stepdaughter who's 12. So I do completely understand the, the schedule, the feeling of not being able to really get into ourselves as much as we are with our kids. And I'm sure everyone on here has kids, or have helped raise kids, and things like that. And it's a big responsibility.", "4266": "I personally, I try to eat healthy, I try to take very good care of myself, but I think my kids force it upon me more than I do. They keep me very active, they keep me running. And we like to find things to give back to the community in [inaudible 00:31:33], my love. I appreciate you guys for inviting me. The libraries, Ms. Sarah, with the gardens, things like this is what I do wish you if you other ladies don't have in your community, I wish that there's something that maybe we can all get together and start building, because it is definitely something that is productive, and it's uplifting.", "4267": "And like you said, Ms. Speller, I know you said back in your prime, and I'm 30 as well, so I feel like I may be pushing my 40 sometimes ...", "4268": "(silence).", "4269": "Lanesha, are you there? Okay. Did everybody get a chance to share? Did we get everybody, Jazmin?", "4270": "Yeah.", "4271": "All right. Awesome. Wonderful. So we're just going to keep moving right along. We want to move on to the conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. And I know that we already touched a little bit about this, so you guys are ahead of schedule.", "4272": "So when you're responding to questions, if you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you're thinking of when you share your story. I have a few questions to start us off, but we hope that this will be a time for some back and forth among you. This is what Jazmin was referring to Heather, so get your questions ready. I invite you to respond to the points that really resonate with you when they're made by others in the group. But we want to make sure that we're being mindful that everyone who wants to participate can.", "4273": "Let's see. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people and places that positively contributed to your community's health and wellbeing? Feel free to share a story from your experience that really help us understand this just a little bit better. And I'm going to pass it to Heather to start us off.", "4274": "Okay. I really want to speak to Latasha. Latasha, so I want to say ... I mean, I want to use my one minute to just say to you, I do not on any level want it to seem like I have it figured out, like I'm just this paragon of Evian water, and Tai Chi. And I'm not about that on any level. No, not at all. I was actually trying .... Hopefully, I conveyed the opposite, which is that I'm really busy. I got a lot going on.", "4275": "I mean, before COVID, I mean, my sort of go-to staple food was Fritos and sour cream and onion potato chips just because I had no time. And the only point I was trying to make is that, now that I'm physically at home, physically here, with nowhere else to go, and I'm a college professor, I'm expected to stay here. I actually went to work one day last week, I physically went to my job, and my boss, my Dean was like, \"Go home. You're not supposed to be here.\" So I went back home.", "4276": "And so, what I want to say to you is that, I think you're fabulous, I think you're awesome. And as an aside, I think you said you worked for the Staten Island Youth Justice Center, maybe that's what you said? That's the reason why I'm on Staten Island, by the way, because 10 years ago, a man named Arnold Adams contacted me on email and he asked me if I did workshops on Staten Island and I didn't. And I said, \"I'll come there.\" And he worked for the now Staten Island Youth Justice Center. And so, I love you guys. The work you do is amazing. You can ask anybody who's there, Jackie is my heart, and I've known her for a decade. And so, I love what you do.", "4277": "But I also know that what you do is really tough, it's really hard, it's a lot of work, it's backbreaking. Because I also do a lot of work with the Queens Youth Justice Center, the equivalent of you. And so what I would say to you is that I care for you, you're in my heart. And the fact that you don't have time to maybe do some of what you'd like to do for yourself is completely understandable.", "4278": "And if you want a buddy to do stuff with, I would love to do with you. And since we're all remote, maybe we could figure out a way to be buddies together virtually. Because I drink water and I walk, but I should be doing a lot more stuff. I should be doing pushups, and squats, and sit ups. I don't do any of that. My belly is ... I mean, I'm a skinny person, but it's like I got to work on my belly, and I got to work on like other things.", "4279": "So I told my story basically to say for a long time I didn't take care of myself. For this moment, because I'm an introvert, which I am, and I [inaudible] that I'm a huge introvert, being able to be at home alone and do these things has been so amazing. And so, I would love to be a workout buddy with you, and we could like do stuff together. So maybe we can talk offline and do that because I would love it. I think you're amazing and fabulous, and so maybe we could be buddies together of doing that if you would like, and we can ... I'm slow. I'm slow and I'm old, it doesn't appear that way. I'm slow and I'm old, so we can be slow together, and if you can keep up with me, I'll keep up with you. Or if you will allow me to be with you, we could do it together. What do you think?", "4280": "Yeah, I'm all for it, definitely, definitely.", "4281": "Yay.", "4282": "That's wonderful.", "4283": "Let's do it, okay?", "4284": "Okay.", "4285": "So we can be all live or we could do it on Staten Island because I'm on Staten Island five days a week in normal life, so you can come to my garden, and we can do like super cool stuff. I have a garden at Prospect Avenue in Clyde.", "4286": "Okay.", "4287": "So we can do workout stuff and support each other. How about it?", "4288": "Okay. Yes. I'm all for it. Thank you.", "4289": "Great. [crosstalk 00:38:43]. We'll talk offline, okay? So that's all I had I to say. If I say nothing else, it's just like connecting with Latasha, and making sure that we become cool workout buddies.", "4290": "Thank you.", "4291": "That's amazing. It sounds like ... We'll make sure that you too are connected via email. But it sounds like that's another community resource, really finding community partners to be able to promote health and wellbeing through physical activity and therapeutic spaces. That is awesome.", "4292": "I want to pass it to ... [crosstalk] I think, forgive me, I have forgotten the order of ... Latasha, are you next?", "4293": "I don't know.", "4294": "Yeah. So originally the order was Heather, Latasha, Taqiya, Kendall.", "4295": "Awesome.", "4296": "But, whatever, people can pass or go when they feel like it.", "4297": "And I just want to remind everybody that the question is in the chat just in case you forget. So thanks so much, Jazmin.", "4298": "Okay. Yeah, I do need to take a look at the question again. But I do want to thank Heather for that, even the fact that you're able to find time with me. I know I spoke about healthy, and to me, like eating healthy, and working out. And I realized everything I'm mentioning, it has a lot to do with my mental health. And I think that's just what it is, because having to be home all day, I guess it is messing with me. I have had points where I just felt too stressed, where it didn't even felt like I slept because I'm thinking in my sleep, I'm thinking so much, it doesn't even feel like I'm sleeping. I've gotten past that.", "4299": "But there was points during the stay-at-home when I felt like that. So I do think that's probably part of what the reason is why I'm just finding it so difficult to just like, hey, workout, get up early, do this, watch what you eat? It's just so much easier to be like, huh, I don't feel like it, or after a long day. And my kids are quite handful, so even just after that, I'm just like, I need a break, I just want to sit down. Even just sitting here right now is like, okay, I feel calmer. I don't have to worry about what time I'll wake up tomorrow.", "4300": "So, yeah, I do realize it is my mental health that probably needs to be relieved, but I don't think that'll really be until things probably somewhat go back to normal. Even with the schools, we don't know how it's going to be next school year, so September. And that's something I'm thinking about, and it's a struggle now, but we don't actually have to go back to the office until, the earliest would be September 1st.", "4301": "So it's like, okay, when school starts, and they're talking about doing maybe half at home, half there, or whatever the case is about, who's going to be home with them? And it's hard now that in, [inaudible] now because I have so many meetings, my husband's really the one that's helping them, and I bet too messes with me, because it's like, all right, he's allowing me to get on my work but he's [inaudible] all night trying to play catch up. So it's a lot.", "4302": "I'm going to answer the question. Let me see, I have to go back and see what it was because I forgot what the question was.", "4303": "We can tell you, so you don't have to read it.", "4304": "Yeah [crosstalk 00:41:39].", "4305": "So it's just what in your community, and you talked a lot about some of the issues and challenges that you're facing right now, and that folks are facing because of the pandemic, but are there things in your community that are working well to support health and wellbeing? And what are some of the people, or places, or things, that have contributed to the health of your community? So it could be a story or just different things that are working.", "4306": "Okay. So I guess like during these times I do take, note, I do ... I'm big, like I said, on resources, so I'm looking at everybody's page, I see the live Zumba, or the live yoga, or Pilates, and I see different things. I even see where people are sharing, \"Hey, if you want to do Keto, or if you want to do this ...\" I know it's there, and other people too, it's there. And having the support, even from Heather, you'll work out with me, that means a lot.", "4307": "So right now, having to be home and just relying on everything from what I'm seeing, what I'm hearing from other CBOs, I guess it's out there, it's just the big push. Where are we going to get the push from, like I said, for me? And I think everything somewhat goes back to normal, or maybe even it might go back to normal tomorrow after the last day of school, once it calms down, we don't have to worry about trying to help the six-year-old with his schoolwork, the baby's still here, I don't know.", "4308": "And I do definitely want to go outside, but even going outside sometimes feels kind of iffy. We went to the boardwalk last weekend, and it was just like the amount of people that they were all together, in groups of kids, young adults, and no masks. And I'm trying to be cautious. I care myself but I don't want to pass that to my children. We try to see our parents here or there. I see my mom maybe once a week. And I don't want to kiss her, we don't want to get other sick, and it was like, all right. I keep telling my husband, I think it's time, I think we should stop the stay-in. We see so much on the news. Even going outside, going to the grocery store, people aren't wearing masks, and they don't care. They bumped you. I'm just like, I don't know, we can't win. Try to go outside, I feel like I shouldn't be outside. In the house I'm losing my mind.", "4309": "But I do know that what I guess would promote it, if the resources that are available. Like I said, I'm big on searching everybody's, that's how I found about the conversation today, looking through everybody's pages, the Staten Island Partnership, [inaudible 00:43:57], everyone, look at every one's pages, and see what resources that they have available. And I guess that's how I'm finding out. That's why I said I'll be more involved in the community.", "4310": "I think that's my first step. I definitely am an introvert. I'm going to say, I consider myself I am. I like to keep to myself, I'm a home body. And I realized during the pandemic, I don't think I'm that much of an introvert as I thought I was because I found myself longing just to like be outside and pass somebody because it was so weird just being in the house the whole day. There was times I was going a week or two without even opening the door, and it was just like, what am I doing? And it was just driving me crazy.", "4311": "So I'm just trying to, I guess, find all the resources, connect, try to meet everyone. I meet people today and everyone knows I work for the Staten Island Justice ... Now it's Staten Island Justice Center, I wanted to let you know that, Heather. They changed it from Staten Island Youth Justice Center in 2016 because we started serving the adults with the SRP program. So it's not Staten Island Justice Center. I know a lot of people are not familiar with it.", "4312": "I know, yeah, yeah.", "4313": "Yeah.", "4314": "[inaudible] told me that. I can't get my head around it [inaudible 00:45:01]. I'm sorry if I used the wrong [inaudible 00:45:05].", "4315": "No, no, no. It's okay. So, yeah, that's what I think. I do know that what ... We're limited at this time having to do it ... Sorry, hold on. What, Amazon ... Turn off. There you go. I'm sorry, I had a reminder on Amazon. But that's really what I was saying.", "4316": "So we know the resources are there. Again, we're limited having to be in doors, doing it live or on a video. I guess once things open up, even we can, I know the Parks Department has a lot of ... I know last summer they did the thing where you could work out in the park, so I did see that. And again, last time I said the same thing, I was like, okay, I'm going to take advantage of it. I'm going to try to go at least once a week. I never did it.", "4317": "I think that's just me. I need to motivate myself. I'm just, like I said, with the two kids and I'm focusing work. Well, last year, I was also pregnant, that too, my son is only two months. I think it was the year before I said I wanted to do it and I never did it, but I'm trying to change that. I'm definitely trying to change that. That's all I'm finished. I'm going to pass it, I think it's Taqiya now.", "4318": "That's awesome, Latasha. Thank you so much.", "4319": "You're welcome.", "4320": "Taqiya, if you're open to it, you're up next.", "4321": "Well, about two years ago, I was in a situation, a domestic violence situation of my youngest son's father. And I decided to get out. I went to the shelter. And I felt like when I went to the shelter, they offered me more mental support because that's what I needed. I needed the mental support in order to finish up school. It was scary at first, it was hard. But, eventually, I graduated school, and I still stay in contact with the people that was helping me there. They share similar insistence that I was going through.", "4322": "So in the community that I live in now currently, I mean, I don't speak to the people as often as much as I'm supposed to. But I think that just by when this pandemic happened, it was just like, it kind of came out of by the time. I know it sounds weird, but I felt like I needed to spend more time and closeness with my children. Because getting up my oldest son, he goes to charter school, so he would have to get up around 6:30 every morning to get to school by 7:30. He would get out of school about 3:45 in the afternoon. My little one, he will go off to daycare.", "4323": "I was in school also. And I felt like Monday through Friday was such a push and pull. And I didn't have enough time to me, I say, reprogram them because sometimes the stuff that they learn in the school [inaudible] will help them ink will help them towards, really too much the future.", "4324": "So when pandemic happened, it was just kind of sort of like a breath of fresh air a little bit. I didn't have to run, and not even have to jump up because there was deadlines or everything was just squeezed in a small amount of time within the day. By the time we would get home in the evening, only thing my oldest son can do was eat, read a book, and go to sleep, because he would have to get up the next day.", "4325": "So I think that the people in the community, sometimes when you're just walking down a block, and you could be frustrated, but you try to put on a happy face, or try to be in the moment. And, yes, the elders of the community, they might stop you, or stop your children and have a little small talk like, \"Listen to your mother, be a good child,\" and stuff like that. And sometimes when your child is hear and you say these things, they don't take heed to what you're saying, but when they hear someone else say it kind of sticks sometimes, because they're like, \"Well, my mother did say that.\" And then another person saying, it's like, \"Oh, well maybe it is true.\"", "4326": "So I think it's just people of the community to be involved. I want to see where it says, it takes a village to raise the children. Where's this village, this village? Because it's definitely hard, there's no instructions to this. It's really not. But that's all I have to say from that.", "4327": "Thank you so much for sharing, Taqiya. Heather, you're saying [inaudible] in your community? Do you feel like they were helpful, or you feel like they're not really supportive?", "4328": "Can you repeat that, Sarah? I didn't hear you.", "4329": "You were talking a little bit about some of the commentary from some of the elders and some of the other community members. Did you feel like that was helpful? And that was [inaudible] support, or did you feel it wasn't helpful?", "4330": "Yeah, the oldest community, I guess just in passing, they're not with any organizations or anything like that, just in passing, they just, I guess, want to give a little bit of advice to, they feel young moms, or single moms, or just people out with children, just in passing. You would just see these people, and they would just give you just advice. Even if you don't ask, some people are just like, \"Well, I think you should ...\" And they'll say, \"I'm not trying to tell you what to do with your children, but I had a child, or my child is this years old ...\" For instance, I was crossing the street the other day, we had an intersection, and my two children would just walk in. And I'm telling them like, \"We're going to pause here, we're going to pause here, we're going to pause here,\" and they're still walking.", "4331": "And I get almost to the middle of the street and they're still walking on the sidewalk. So the lady, she yells. So I got scared, and I turned around, and she was like, \"You don't hear your mother talking to you? Why are you guys not paying attention to your mom?\" She said, \"I had a little daughter who was eight-years-old, and the same thing that you guys are doing to your mom is the same thing she did, and she died. She got hit by a car and she died. She was eight-years-old.\"", "4332": "And I didn't jump in, I didn't say anything. I was like, \"Listen to what she's saying, because obviously I'm singing it and you guys are not listening.\" So when we crossed the street my oldest son was like, \"Oh my gosh, mom, that's so sad.\" And I said, \"Yeah, it is sad, because maybe she was doing the same things I was doing, but being that her daughter wasn't listening, this is the outcome of that.\" And it's sad, it's really, really.\" So that just was a little helpful just push.", "4333": "I don't know if it's like the [inaudible] or the universe, but sometimes when I'm in certain places and I feel frustrated or someone might overhear me, they turn around and start talking to my children like, \"Oh, well, your mom is right,\" just little helpful things.", "4334": "Thank you so much. And I know we're [inaudible] very respectful of everybody's time. [inaudible] on the conversation [inaudible 00:52:38]. We're going to extend it a few more minutes. We want to makes sure that Kendall has a chance to answer the question and then also were going to just wrap it up [inaudible 00:52:56].", "4335": "Hey, Sarah, you're breaking up a little bit. So, Sarah, what you're saying, we want to be respectful of time, but we want to make sure Kendall that you have a chance to answer the question, and then we'll move to the wrap up questions if that's okay with everyone.", "4336": "Awesome. Okay. So what in your community is working well? All right. So how does it relate to things in the community working well to support my health and wellbeing? I'd say, for these current times, it definitely falls on myself and my family, because, obviously, the biggest support in my life, and us just thinking out of the box to get out and do something when we have the time. When I told them my friends we went to like the Six Flags Safari, we drove through and looked at all these wild animals, and that was something so out of the box that I haven't done since I was like seven or eight-years-old, but I'm like, that's something that I would have never thought of doing if it wasn't for these certain times.", "4337": "Then, also like we may go to an open field and run around with my son and play soccer or football. And then things like this, we don't really always time to do that, but now we have so much more time. I feel like we're doing this on a weekly basis, and I'm having a great time doing it, so it is benefiting.", "4338": "Then as it relates to the community, I'm seeing [inaudible] both do things like that as well. And I noticed a lot of community-based organizations they're getting out of the box. And I'm seeing the movie in the park days, and everybody is taking a precaution, doing the social distancing still. And then I'm seeing talks about driving theater coming back. I haven't been in one of those since I was, again, a child in the Midwest, and I'm like, this is awesome to me, but at the same time, it's unfortunate because of the certain pandemic.", "4339": "But, again, like all this is definitely contributing to my health and wellbeing. It's keeping me interested in seeing what else we can do, and how else we can be active. One thing that is still slightly depressing is seeing how many people walk around me without mask and not caring about the precautions that others are taking. So I'm like we need to have a respect for space. So even in that sense of encouraging others, that even though you may not feel that it's important to cover, wear a mask, or whatever, you're not always doing it for yourself. So like now I feel like everybody became an advocate. I don't think I've been ...", "4340": "Every week I'm in a grocery store or at a laundromat, and I'm hearing people just argue, and well, try to educate others on certain things relating to the pandemic, telling them, \"You're not doing it just for you, it's the people next to you, the elders, the children, your neighbors.\" And that's awesome. It's just like everybody became an advocate. And then in a sense it's uplifting, but again, it's just dire times.", "4341": "And my experience before the pandemic, again, like I said, I was always out and about, going to events, cleaning a park, repurposing areas, things like that. I'm highly involved in intergovernmental affairs across the borough, and now somewhat across the State. And I see a lot of the, even the politics, they're starting to become more humanized, because we were in a parking lot, you see a congressman went jogging. And you're like, \"Oh, wait, what, that's a congressman?\" We're like, \"Yeah, you really wouldn't see him randomly and the park because you wouldn't be in the park at this time, right?\" Little things like that, it's definitely like, it's getting everybody to realize we're all on the same level.", "4342": "And I think that definitely feeds in ... It helps in the sense, it helps us a lot, and just develop a greater sense of community. And these virtual conversations that organizations are holding, I feel like I'm on multiple of them each week now, that this will be benefiting for us to have a unique way of connecting and hearing from others, and hearing other brothers' experiences, and then sharing our own if we feel comfortable. Overall, like I said, I would definitely think my family and friends, and then the community-based organizations, probably the uniqueness of these events and activities [inaudible 00:57:21].", "4343": "Thank you so much, Kendall. I'm now convinced he's going to wrap up. But I just want to thank you again for being a part of the [inaudible 00:57:37].", "4344": "Sarah, you're breaking up a little bit. So you say we're going to wrap it up? Is that what you said? Is that what you said?", "4345": "So I know that we're being respectful of time, but I just want to give people one last minute to share thoughts, or feelings, or takeaways. Because, again, like Alex said at the beginning, one of the goals of these conversations is to escalate important issues to policy makers, or advocate. What I've heard a lot from this conversation was that some of these virtual opportunities are good, and there should be more of them because we can't connect in person right now. So those are important. But also this idea of community building, whether that's in-person or electronically while we can't be in person. Is there anything else that folks are feeling like it's an important issue that came out of this conversation that people need to know about?", "4346": "And that's okay if we don't. And I don't want to us ... I normally let us sit in silence, but since we're wrapping up, I don't want us to [inaudible] for too long.", "4347": "So thank you everyone so much for being here. As a reminder, everyone who participates gets a $25 gift card. So just we need to make sure we have your accurate email address. So if you want to put your email address in the chat, or send it to Sarah, who you registered with to make sure that we're correct. And that would be wonderful.", "4348": "And if there are no closing thoughts or feelings, thank you all so much for coming. And we were glad to have this conversation. And there will be a share back opportunity, it'll take a few weeks, but this conversation will be available, and we'll make sure to share with everyone who participated.", "4349": "Can we be connected with each other? I mean, is that possible? I feel like we had this great moment, and then I would like to be connected to all of you. Maybe you wouldn't like to be connected to me, but I like to be connected to you.", "4350": "Heather, I've already connected you. If anyone wants to be connected, I'm happy to do that as a next step. [inaudible 00:59:45].", "4351": "I love it.", "4352": "[crosstalk 00:59:47].", "4353": "I think it'd be great. We're all have these great Staten Island ties. So I would say let's keep it going. I mean, hopefully, for those who want. But this has been like a very fabulous experience for me, and I would like to not let this be the last time that I see all of you. I like this to be the first time of many times. So I would like to see you again.", "4354": "If people are open to that, let Sarah know, and she'll make connections. And it sounds like, again, we're all pretty socially isolated, so this is the time to build some virtual community as Heather has been saying.", "4355": "[crosstalk 01:00:26].", "4356": "And lots of parents in here, and I have a two and a half-year-old, and I'm pregnant, so I would love to talk to other people about struggling to work from home with your children. It's a struggle.", "4357": "[inaudible] and it's just me. So if anybody wants to sort of talk when you have free time, I have no children. I'm children free, children free zone.", "4358": "Watch out, Heather, we're going to drop our kids off at your house and go back.", "4359": "I have [crosstalk] apartment, so bring it on.", "4360": "Thank you so much everyone. Have a beautiful night. I hope you enjoy the rest of your night. And thank you so much. We'll talk ...", "4361": "...Was not going to [inaudible]. So the video won't be kept but the audio will become part of the record and it will be transcribed and it's all entirely anonymous, you can be sure of that. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, as Alex intimated beforehand, first we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. And we want to create a unique listening channel through which we are able to lift up the voices and needs of our communities to local policy makers and members of the media as well.", "4362": "So we're inviting you to have a different kind of conversation that's focused on sharing our stories from our experiences and, rather than beginning with our positions or thoughts on issues, just talking about this from our own perceptions and points of views. And we invite you to share your experiences, you don't have to say anything personal, please don't, too personal about health stuff but more about your perceptions of well-being.", "4363": "And now I have to read this verbatim because it's the disclaimer. So, this conversation is being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in the project, at Cordico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cordico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations and communities and in the media, to improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in local newspaper or website or be broadcast on local radio station or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media, so please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. And if you understand this, please say \"I agree\". I don't know how everyone else's screen is appears but maybe we can go Emily, [Mi-Young Hay 00:02:11], Paris, Diane and then Jack, can you just each please say \"I agree. I agree to that\". Thank you.", "4364": "I agree.", "4365": "I agree.", "4366": "I agree.", "4367": "And Jack? Oh I think you're...", "4368": "Muted.", "4369": "Muted. So I think you're still muted somehow.", "4370": "Jack, there's a button in your lower left-hand corner of your screen. I don't know if it's the same in an iPhone but it has a little microphone on it.", "4371": "Can you hear now?", "4372": "Yes.", "4373": "Yes. Perfect. Thank you.", "4374": "Okay. I agree.", "4375": "Wonderful. Tank you. So moving along, we want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to share and to learn from each other in this conversation. So there are a couple of guidelines for the conversation and I'll just briefly go over them. There was mentioned before, but speak for yourself and out of your own experiences and allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time and allow others to finish speaking, take turns, stay curious, ask honest questions, pause and take time for reflection. Listen generously and assume everyone has good intentions, as they speak. And, when possible, close other distracting programs, etc if it help stay focused.", "4376": "So is everyone okay with those general guidelines?", "4377": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). Everything good.", "4378": "Good.", "4379": "Okay. Good. All right so, just to get started briefly, we're going to use the circle, so we'll go around with each of us taking turns. And you can always pass, if you don't want to answer a question, feel free to say \"I pass\" and that's good, if you like.", "4380": "And so we're going to start with a round of introductions. And say your first name, and if you don't want to use your first name because it's going to be transcribed, you can make up a name. And that's fine too. And talk a little about who you are, where you live and what you do and share a value that's important to you, and what brought you here today.", "4381": "So I'll start with that. So, my name is Deb and I work with Project Hospitality as a media consultant, grant writer and that's how I ended up being here, to be a part of facilitating this conversation. I'm a former journalist and I've lived in Staten Island in the North Shore for... Feels like forever but it's been about 12 years. I'm from Los Angeles originally. And a value that is important to me is integrity because I think, when you come from a place of truths with yourself and with other people, everything can flow out from there. So that's my introduction and we'll go in the circle, Emily... Tell your name, a little about yourself, your first name and where you live. I live on the North shore, Staten Island. And a value that's important to you.", "4382": "I'm Emily, I'm a native Staten Islander. I live on the North Shore also, grew up here. I'm a teacher and why I'm probably here is my relationship with Deb. Good friends. I don't know, one value that I hold very important is kindness and caring for others, [inaudible]. Small and large.", "4383": "Thanks.", "4384": "Hi. My name is Mi-Young Hay and I live on Staten Island and I'm originally from South Korea. I been here... I don't know how long it's been, long time, maybe 30 years. I teach art in public school and I think it's important in life that you take care of actually... First. So you can be healthy, physically and all other aspects. [inaudible] and all that so you can be healthy, being in a community and help others, as well. Thank you.", "4385": "Hi. I'm Jack. I am originally from Brooklyn.", "4386": "Oh, another Brooklyn guy, me too.", "4387": "Raised in Brooklyn.", "4388": "Yep.", "4389": "Brooklyn, New York. Sunset Park. And I live now, I'm in West New York, New Jersey. I'm a retired audio engineer. To me, what I value most, is integrity. If you don't have integrity, you don't have anything. Your word is your bond. That's about it.", "4390": "Thank you.", "4391": "Hi everybody, my name is Paris. I'm originally from Brooklyn. From Williamsburg, Green Point, Brooklyn. I've been in Staten Island with my significant other. I've known her for about, what now... How long has it been?", "4392": "Oh long time, 17 years.", "4393": "17 years. So I've been here pretty much regularly for about five years or so. And looking at it through new eyes. I really discovered probably a lot more than she probably has in the 17 years that she's been here. Introducing her to a lot of stuff.", "4394": "But anyway, I was invited here by Deb. This is my first time, so I don't know how much input that I can put in, as far as what the topic discussion is here but I'll do the best that I can and I guess that's it for now. I'm semi-retired, so that's about it. Go ahead.", "4395": "All right. I'm Diane and I've been living here in the North Shore on Staten Island. I'm originally from Barbados but I've been living here on the North Shore for 25 years. I'm a teacher, I teach at Curtis High School and I'm a part-time artist and sculptor and... I have to say, one of my... The values that I hold dearest is honestly. I believe in honesty. If we can be honest with ourselves and honest with each other and our communities, then I believe that's a good first step, in terms of moving forward and achieving good health and mindfulness.", "4396": "That's one of the reasons why we are of the same votes. Anything that she says or I say reflects one or the other, so that's it, right?", "4397": "Yes.", "4398": "It's going to build all foundations on integrity and honestly and kindness and... To carry yourself all sorts of... To allow all that to happen. Thank you.", "4399": "And so the next thing we're going to do is talk a little more about health and wellbeing. From your point of view. And take a minute to really think about a time... What health and wellbeing look like to you in a time or place, or story when you felt like you were your best, in terms of your health and wellbeing. And what can you remember about and why you might have felt your healthiest or the best, in the sense of wellbeing. And factors that supported your health at that time and if you wanted to describe how you feel. Or how you felt in this moment. And we'll go around and take some time to share our stories. So no need to disclose any sensitive information again, it's being recorded, as you know. But generally, to reflect on... And what health means to you, form your personal experience.", "4400": "For this one, I'll start, just jump in. I think all of us everywhere have thought a good bit about health during times of late, as everyone's been inside to protect our health. So I'm going to go to a more recent experiences, after having been cooped up with COVID, with craziness abounding. Two occasions recently, I got out and got to go camping and it was almost a physical sensation of relief and wellbeing, to be outside. I was surprised, actually, by how much better I felt the second we left the house and put up the tent and I walked around under the trees. And I marveled at that because I'm one of these people that it's hard to relax. It's hard for me to relax and the relaxation just came easily to me. And I had a sense of wellbeing because of being outside. I would imagine being with family and having an ease that there weren't as many pressures that I had been experiencing, up until that moment.", "4401": "And recently I went camping again a couple of days ago and there was a thunderstorm and the rain was pounding against the tent and it felt very relaxing, strangely enough. To feel safe in this temporary structure, holistically so. So that it would be my recent memory, they don't have to be recent, of when I have felt a sense of wellbeing. So I'll just pass along, Emily you want to share something?", "4402": "When you first asked, I immediately thought of a time when we first met, 20-something years ago. Studying meditation, moving meditation. And again, it was a similar thing where, meeting early morning at the beach and just the combination of nature and meditation and... A safe [inaudible] experience both of those things in and it's very important. More recently... When you were talking I realized that in the midst of all of this anxiety and sickness, quiet walks in the park is completely mind-changing, surrounded by trees and [inaudible]. As long as the park's not too crowded, I am at peace very quickly. That's all.", "4403": "I used to be a Buddhist and after left the temple, always struggle to balance out the peaceful mind and the trying to understand the world. And the balance between the actual life, what's happening, the family, the school, all that. So I think finding once [inaudible] and finding the answer, trying to get the answer, I don't know if we can get all the answers but trying to get the answers. Different moment, different time period, different situation. Really become part of our wellbeing. Last summer, I think August, one week... retreat, it was the retreat and... I was monk for [inaudible] years, so [inaudible] easy, but it was a quite challenging and... But that was such a [inaudible] thing that... 15 years of teaching, the stress and all that, I'm in a sabbatical this year and they gave me really a good belief that I was nodded inside about what's happening in the world and what's the relationship with me and the world and family, all that. And I think that that, kind of like peaceful [inaudible] and alone time is important. Searching for the enlightenment.", "4404": "Okay. I've always been a physical person, an athletic person and that's my happy place. If I can move, my job has always been very physical. And I've always been an athlete, my daughter's an athlete and I spent like 17 years training her. So if I'm not being physical, it weighs on my brain, it weighs on my head. Right now, since contracting this virus and what it's done to me, it makes me crazy to have to sit at home, all these months. I think it brings on anxiety, I've had to find a different happy place. You have to dig inside yourself and find out what else is in there, besides going to the gym every day. Or doing laps in the pool, whatever. I spent five weeks in the hospital, so being home is a big deal. It's a big deal.", "4405": "Yeah, congrats.", "4406": "Right now, it's what's making me happy.", "4407": "That's beautiful perspective. Thank you for sharing.", "4408": "It's funny, I hear all of this commonality. Because Diane and I, we discussed this. She's a Buddhist, I come from a Roman Catholic background, I'm just a spiritual person and I got to embrace all of it. And it's all I did, trying to find your center in the middle of all this chaos and like Jack, I'm very physical, I've always been athletic all of my life. And since being here on Staten Island, I would go to [Nick Lear] Park right over here, introduced myself to various activities like taking the mass to compost accord, doing volunteer work in the area. It's terrific and I made a lot of friends out there, teaching Qigong and Tai Chi, which I've been doing half my life. I've made a lot of friends with the kids here but [McKee] and just various other people I've taken as regular students of mine, as Deb knows.", "4409": "And this whole idea of trying to find something different. In this particular case, I identify with Jack, I'm a very physical kind of person. But yet, if you don't... In this Coronavirus situation, if you depend on that exclusively to your release for your anxiety and all that sort of thing, which we all have a certain way of penting it up and needing a release to that. We all have different ways of doing it. But this whole idea of an Eastern tradition of meditation, of finding peace and balance, without having to really eat or be active. Because we've gotten so used to that sort of thing, this go world that we live in that now, all of a sudden, our backs are up against the wall and now we're looking at ourselves in the mirror and then having to reevaluate all of that, I think is pretty important. And I think that's probably, for a lot of people, that's the next phase of really having to look at themselves. And to understand themselves in a much different way that they never did before. And that's a good thing, it can be potentially a good thing.", "4410": "I don't want to ramble on and get too heavy with it but, for me, I find movement and stillness. Even as a moving meditation, instead of being so physically active to the point where you think you have to constantly sweat and pound the pavement all the time, isn't just the only way to do it, there are many other alternatives to do that and to bring that kind of center and balance back into your life. And it's a mindful kind of a thing, but its also a practice, it's pragmatic. It's something that has to be worked at, it's something that has to be developed and a lifestyle. It's a little bit of an effort, like anything else but If you do that, in whatever way or capacity that you do, however you find, it can work to your advantage.", "4411": "And everybody has to find their own way and develop their own style. I've developed my own style, Diane has developed her own particular style, physical compromise that she has and I work with her. And sometimes I have to slow myself down but that doesn't necessarily mean that it hinders me and it actually brings out a lot more different characteristics that I won't normally do, if I weren't around someone like that, it actually makes me even more mindful. So I think that the situation and circumstances can actually be a benefit and not a hindrance. A lot of it has to do with attitude and your own mindset and how you look at the reality of the world around you. Which can make it either glass half full or glass half empty.", "4412": "A lot of it is about your... The way you look at things.", "4413": "Yeah. Perception is reality. No doubt about it. And I think that, in our Western culture today, I think a lot is starting to come to light now because a lot of this, being pushed up against a wall, because nobody really took the time. Because we're all distracted, media and cellphones and there's always something that's compromising our time or drawing our attention to our time. And now all of a sudden, when none of that is not around anymore... I ready a study that all of a sudden, people are not really that in-tune to social media anymore now because of the fact that their back is up against the wall and they're forced to have to social distance and not have to see the people that they normally would. So now they want to see the people and they don't want to go on the computer and [crosstalk] and they're looking forward to have to go and want to see people because they can't.", "4414": "So it's like anything else, if something you really cherish that you take for granted is all of a sudden taken away, you don't know that you have it until you lose it. And I think that's what's happening to a lot of people right now, a lot of things we've taken for granted now that we think that we've lost, is really not necessarily a bad thing. It's really just a time for a new kind of reflection in order to be able to see things new and hopefully, in the long term, much more better, much more enlightened way. More appreciative way and make us better people for it and strengthen our relationships with ourselves and everybody else.", "4415": "Experiment-", "4416": "How I look at it, that's my particular point of view.", "4417": "Thank you, it's a lot of insight and a lot of truth. Diane, did you have a time in your life you want to describe, where you felt a sense of wellness and what contributed to that?", "4418": "Absolutely, I love gardening, so [crosstalk]", "4419": "Diane, just one moment. If anybody who's not speaking, if you could actually mute yourselves just cause there's some static coming in and I just don't want it to affect hearing everybody else. Thank you so much. Sorry about that.", "4420": "No problem. Yes. First I will say, I have to leave so I'm going to share my piece and then I have to leave because I have another zoom meeting at this time. But I just want to say that, what gives me peace is being in the garden. And I will spend hours just looking at the plants. It's almost like I want to watch them grow minute by minute, second by second. And I'm drawn to the deep greens, I'm drawn to the colors, I observe nature and it just makes me very calm. And whenever I feel anxious, if I can get out and be in the garden, that is my place of peace. I don't need to run laps, I just need to be among the greenery.", "4421": "And you're all invited to come over because we got so much damn lettuce, we got to get rid of it. We can't eat it all. And we got all this stuff growing here too, she's driving me nuts with this stuff. And I helped her with the garden cause she wanted it and all. And I do all the work, and she does the thing but I try to do most of the bulk work. We got stuff growing, its coming out of our ears. And people next door, and we're sharing food and... So if yous guys like lettuce and basil and parsley...", "4422": "That's amazing.", "4423": "...And tomatoes, and we got the zucchini coming up and we got the other stuff.", "4424": "Bye, Diane, thank you so much.", "4425": "Goodbye.", "4426": "All right, there you go.", "4427": "We'll come visit your garden.", "4428": "Have a great day.", "4429": "Yeah, got some gardeners here, that's amazing. And it is, I think, the commonalities, as you said, being outside, being able to be physical. And also in the absence of the ability to be physical, to be able to be mentally, have different avenues for wellness, based on your perspective or meditation. The outdoors, of course.", "4430": "So thanks for sharing, and now... So briefly we're going to go onto the next question which really has to do with your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing of your community. For the purposes of the conversation, we can think about the community broadly. Whether it's your immediate neighborhood, whether it's your social community or any other kind of community that you can think of. Where you can figure out what health and wellbeing might be in the context of that.", "4431": "So there are a few questions, we can start off and we can go around and take turns to answer and open up the conversation a little bit, and making sure everyone has the opportunity to participate. And so here's a question to think about and then we'll move forward with some answers.", "4432": "This is the last point of discussion for today but, what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? And what are some of the people, places or things that could have positively contributed to your or your community's health and wellbeing? And if you want to share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little bit better that would be great. And what are you learning about your community's health and wellbeing during the pandemic that you want others to understand? Again, if you'd like to share a story that illustrates that, that's fine.", "4433": "So if you can think just a little about, whatever community. I, for example, live in St. George, New Brighton, near the ferry. And my community has, as Paris was pointing out, access to a lot of products which has been... It promotes the capacity to be outside and be away from your immediate place. And for people who are lucky enough to get there because they have time, means of transportation and are able to prioritize it. That's a wonderful aspect of our community. On Staten Island, where we live. So I'm just going to open it up, Emily, if you want to start with some perceptions about your community in any way and what supports the wellbeing?", "4434": "Oops. Oh I think you're muted. I think you have to unmute. You're muted. Wait. Oh there you are.", "4435": "So what immediately have to mind was just the community of being a teacher in the New York Department of Education. I felt tremendously supported when they finally decided to close the schools. I was extremely grateful that somebody cared enough for our wellbeing to make that huge decision. I had already decided to take my kids out of school, I wasn't sure how I was going to do that and work at the same time but I am very grateful that I had the support of a city [inaudible] that continued to pay my salary and enable me to take care of myself. Was there a second...", "4436": "Yeah. You touched on both questions in one. Feeling the support and then also a story about the pandemic, so thank you for that insight and that's true. That was a policy decision that impacted how many millions of kids? What, million kids? And then teachers and... It was a community-wide, city-wide decision, based on wellness, and it was interesting to hear your perspective, as a teacher and an individual in that. Cause there was a degree of care-taking in that.", "4437": "Absolutely.", "4438": "If you want to pass, you can also... But think about it, if anyone wants to jump in.", "4439": "Quick. I live on West Brighton and I go to park every day. Sometimes twice a day and I see a lot of people that catches my eyes is teenagers gathering number of five or six. Yesterday I saw group of students, they were [wanners] and they are still... They were not wearing any masks and they were not keeping distance. So I worried about that. My son's wanner. At some point probably he will be joining and I don't want that when that going to be. So I think maybe I will pass from here.", "4440": "Good point too because, in a pandemic, community health is... Takes a whole different meaning cause you're responsible for yourself but you're also responsible for others.", "4441": "Yes. I try to wear my mask most of the time. It's hot, I cannot wear it 100% all the time, at the park. But when passing, especially with elders or pregnant woman. When they pass definitely I, from a distance already, I put it on. So I pass that. When I see some people, right in the middle. I have to climb the tree maybe to avoid them, they don't have a mask and they're running or talking loud. That makes me nervous. So community is [crosstalk] ways, I have think about that.", "4442": "Yeah. I kind of understand that too. When I see people with no mask, it makes me so nervous. I've been hospitalized twice since March and I tell myself that I don't know if I have another run. It just makes... I was in Hoboken today, at the doctor's, and... Like you were saying, it's mostly younger people. Hoboken is a very young residential place. And most of them, they just refuse to wear a mask. They just refuse to and I wish I had videotape of my time in hospital and they can see the reality. They could see the reality of what this thing does. And, as far as my town, West New York, I live right on the Hudson. I look out my bedroom window and I see the skyline of Manhattan and there's maybe half a mile of parkland. So it's the perfect place to recover. I get out, I walk and it's a very immigrant-friendly place and a lot of South Americans, Cubans and... They all seem to get it. Everybody seems to get it here in my town, everybody wears a mask, they respect the social distancing.", "4443": "Even, I walk to the part, later I'll go out and there's a Zumba class at 6:30. And in the morning, there's yoga. And I'm surprised that, in this community, where this pandemic has hit so hard, that these people get it and they know what they have to do to stay healthy and to keep their families healthy. So I guess I'm kind of fortunate that I'm living here right now. The community here, I'm so surprised when I look at the news and I see what's going on in Manhattan and in Brooklyn and in other communities where there's... I see in front of the bars and restaurants, you got 20, 30, 50 people and they have no clue. Everyone think they're invincible. They think they're invincible and its just not so. I just pray that they'll get it.", "4444": "That's one of the things with young people, they think they're immortal. Nothing's ever going to happen to them.", "4445": "Yeah.", "4446": "That's typical of... Maybe if we were young in the same way, we'd probably be doing the same thing but I think it's a level of maturity and a level of understanding and realization. It's like anything, experience can't be taught, it's got to be lived, until it actually happens to them or happens to somebody that's close to them and they see it first hand and it becomes real, and it hits home. It's abstract to them. It's sad to say, sad commentary. It's what it is to be human, we're not all up at the same level, at the same speed. There's nothing you can do about it, you just got to do what you know and what your conscious self. And even though you're in the eye of the storm, you're in the storm, you can still be in the eye of the storm where it's calm and try to redact and try to live accordingly. To keep yourself safe and negotiate the times that we're living it and it's probably the best that anybody could do.", "4447": "And be fortunate, like you said, being in a certain geographical area where it gives you a little bit more freedom, in terms of not as much population and...", "4448": "Absolutely.", "4449": "...Things of that sort. So not everybody's the same in that regard, so... And I can understand a lot of people too, maybe a lot of these young people too, they feel like \"Well, look, the world is all screwed up. You got climate change, you got this thing, you got that thing and now everybody's losing their jobs\". And maybe they got the attitude like \"You're here today, gone tomorrow, I'm going to go out there and live my life\". And I've actually heard people say that. Again, everybody's got their own perspective and their own level of consciousness about what they value, in terms of living and life and other things that other people may not value as much, or have a different perspective. Or a different perception, which becomes their reality. How do you change that? You can't. I found out myself you can't change people. That's for damn sure, you can't change nobody.", "4450": "If you're on the same page or level of people you associate with that are same [inaudible] and they have the same values and you have that same comradery with them and then share those same values, that's group and that's the unity. Unfortunately, when you look around the world, just with this pandemic. If you look at some of the stuff that's been going on lately, places like South Korea, Taiwan, even Hong Kong who've got the studies early on that this pandemic was going to have some lethality. They jumped on it immediately with testing and you see whole communities, young people, with masks on, just bringing food and everybody getting tested. It was like one mind, one hive mind, everybody was working together. And you look at what's going on here in the United States, like you said, there are certain pockets of people that live right across your own town and they have a completely different attitude. It's like nobody's on the same page.", "4451": "How do you make people go on the same page? Anthony Fauci can say things until he's blue in the face but people have to make that decision themselves. So the culture here in America is totally different than what all the cultures in various other parts of the world who've contained it. Weather its New Zealand, or whatever. Even despite, they might have a little bit of a setbacks, people, second wave or whatever. Some new infections but the very minimal. Even then, they jump on it immediately. They don't take anything for granted. Whereas today, in a lot of the leadership that you have here in the United States and look what you've got. They can't even pass a resolution on bills, let alone... A value to the pandemic.", "4452": "The individual is the only reality, I've always said that to myself and I've learned that a long time ago. I'm a Greek selfist myself. And I think it's true, the ancients had it right and it seems like things do come around a full circle. And I think that, if you look at history in its entirety and if you look at in a long perspective, looking at it in a long review, there ain't nothing new under the sun. All we do is just rehash the same old stuff and relearn the same old things that people have already known.", "4453": "And I think we're going through the same times right now, today. Weather it's in America or in the world, at large and that's the way I see it.", "4454": "It's interesting talking about community because us, living in Staten Island, you think about your immediate community and the attitude and things [inaudible]. All of those insights. It's the smaller community where you live or the community of your work or your... That sort of thing and then we all share the truth of being in the community of this country. And what that means, as Paris pointed out, that idea of individuality and the fact that it's hard to have some sense of uniformity. Whether that's because of age or where you live, or any of that. And that is... It's an interesting truth to be in, as an American right now, I think.", "4455": "I'm listening to what's going on where you live, Jack, and thinking \"Oh, wouldn't it be nice?\". And that's the culture of a certain place and it makes you think the pandemic has brought to light many aspects of the very physical neighborhood where you are, just in terms of everybody's response to the pandemic, or different people's response and conversations that come up about it.", "4456": "I spoke with someone yesterday who was convinced that it was media hoax and I was surprised that people still believe that.", "4457": "That only goes to show you too that truth is relative, like a lot of things that are relative. And I think, in a lot of ways, if you want to look at the bright side of it. You could me despairing and make that perception your reality. But it's also a time of growth and renewal. It's a time of this particular time and place, as many peoples all across time in deep history, whether it's the 1918 pandemic or any other... The Black Plague or the Bubonic Plague. That one-third of Europe's population. We're still here. So there's lessons to be learned, so look at it in a brighter side. There's something to be learned. From what we look at as a negative experience, they're relatives based upon how you absorb it and then how you give it back into the world.", "4458": "And we've had a lot of these discussions, from that perspective. It's nothing new. People have known this for a very long time and they adapt and they change and they do what they have to do. They make do with what they have. And hopefully you try to get to the other side of the... The light at the other side of the tunnel. [crosstalk]. We can't control everything.", "4459": "Yeah.", "4460": "We can't control everything. The only thing we can control is ourselves and how we look at the world.", "4461": "Yeah.", "4462": "And how we relate to the world and what absorbs and affects us. [inaudible] is useful, this car is useless, just give it back and make it work. That's all anybody can really do.", "4463": "When I hear people still saying that this is a hoax, I show them this. This is my life vest I'm wearing a life vest because this virus destroyed my heart muscle. So this is to prevent sudden death, in the event that my heart stops beating. At any time. And hopefully it works.", "4464": "And I tell them, \"If you don't like wearing a mask, you're going to hate a ventilator. You're going to hate it\". It's like saying \"Why do I have to wear seat belts? We have breaks\". It just behooves me when people still call it a hoax and they call it \"Well, it's just a cold\" and \"It's made up\" and it's this and it's that and there's hundreds of thousands of people dying. Hundreds of thousands.", "4465": "While I was in the hospital, I kept getting notices on my phone. I work in the music industry and people that I work with, and I know and... Just getting this and not making it through a week. A couple of days in the hospital on a respirator and done. That's the reality of this and, like you said, you can't change anybody's mind. And you can't convince them, whatever. The only thing you can do is show them the truth and they do with it what they want.", "4466": "That's right.", "4467": "I could tell you all day the stove is hot. If you chose to still put your hand on the stove, then that's up to you.", "4468": "That's right.", "4469": "Everyone's like \"Well, we have freedom in this country. We have freedom of speech, freedom of this\", but you know what? All those freedoms come with consequences.", "4470": "That's right.", "4471": "There's consequences to everything, I spent time in the Rink War and I fought for the right for you to have these freedoms. But it doesn't mean I get to trample all over them and just use them to disadvantage other people because I think, if you're not wearing a mask and you're not following the rules, social distance, whatever... If you want to be sick, I don't care, that's on you. If you don't care about catching this virus, it's on you.", "4472": "It's like back in the day, I went through the AIDS epidemic, you know what? If you don't wear a condom...", "4473": "Right.", "4474": "...That's on you. Merry Christmas. But I worry about you spreading it to me or my kid. And then we go home and we spread it to our family. My wife is an ICU nurse and she just worries every day that she was going to get me sick. And she went through all these months without even a cough. It's just how freaky this thing is.", "4475": "Yeah. Absolutely.", "4476": "It's so freaky. She was just so careful, every time coming through the door. She would strip at the door and go straight to the bathroom and shower and do whatever. And still, here I am in organ failure and she doesn't even have a cold. So, it's almost like this thing, it picks and chooses.", "4477": "Right.", "4478": "It picks and chooses. They're finding, like you said, younger people now are contracting it and, in the beginning, they said \"Well, it's only elderly and people with pre-existing conditions\". And now they're finding these young kinds are having heart problems from it. So, in my soul, in my heart, I feel like the universe is resetting itself.", "4479": "She says the same thing. Yeah.", "4480": "They're like \"You know what? You guys have been a bunch of assholes for a long time, all right?\" And the skies over India and L.A., they're blue again.", "4481": "Yeah.", "4482": "You have yo see the water in the Hudson, it looks so much better. It's outside my window, it looks so much better. And I think, everything that's going on, it's even politically and the protest in the street. You know what? Everybody's in the same boat at the same time, for once. For once, everybody's feeling the same thing in this country. There's no work, there's no jobs, everyone's sick, people are dying. And it's not just one type of person. It's not the black community, it's not the poor community or rich people are dying form this. Poor people are dying. Nobody has a job. Everyone's worrying about how they're going to eat.", "4483": "The great equalizer. It's the great equalizer, yeah.", "4484": "Exactly.", "4485": "It's the great equalizer. And that's something that was probably coming... That was something that was long... I used to say to her all the time, I says, \"2020 there's probably going to be an event that's going to take place. Whether it's another financial meltdown, or whatever the case may be. But there is going to be some kind of a reckoning because the road that we've been traveling on is unsustainable and toxic\".", "4486": "Yeah.", "4487": "So something had to be done. Here it is, this thing came along, which, honestly, I've done a little bit of research. Deb knows about this, I'm writing about it. Peter Alexander who was part of the NIH and part of the other... Part of the team there wrote several letter in late December when the Wuhan virus came about. They knew about it. He wrote two letters, one at the end of January, on my birthday, by the way, then again in February. And the country and the Trump administration chose to ignore it. They chose to think in their perception of reality that they made [crosstalk].", "4488": "...With this too. And we could probably go on and on and on.", "4489": "Yeah.", "4490": "And Jack, liked to listen to your experiences of having to live through this is...", "4491": "It's incredible.", "4492": "...Eye-opening. And I honor you for pushing forward in your perspective.", "4493": "Jack, like you said, Diane's a sister who is also a nurse, contracted the virus-", "4494": "And there's so many stories and there's so many truths. But I think we're also-", "4495": "And then I'm just going to say a few words to kick us off before I pass it over to Lynn. And Lynn, do you want me to read of the rights language and everything like that, or do you want to read that piece?", "4496": "If you could read it, that would be great.", "4497": "Okay, great. So, Simone, you mentioned that this is your first time using Zoom I know that there are some others on this call who are fairly new to Zoom. So just a couple of things to get you all acquainted. In your upper right-hand corner, there is a button that looks like a grid, if that is not pushed, if you're not looking at the grid view of everybody on the screen, I definitely encourage you to press that because it's going to help you at least feel like we're all having a conversation together.", "4498": "I don't have that. All I see as a record in my right hand, it's a red little button that says record, that's all I have.", "4499": "Okay. So it might be different depending on... Are you on a computer or are you on an iPad?", "4500": "I'm on a iPad.", "4501": "Okay. So I wish that I had an iPad up in front of me to see how you could view. There might be a toolbar that says view but if not, don't worry, we can see you.", "4502": "No problem.", "4503": "The most important thing is that you can hear everybody. And if you're on a computer or if you can find it on your iPad or phone a way that you can see everybody. Oh, Monique just buzzed in. So [crosstalk 00:01:29].", "4504": "I don't know what I did.", "4505": "So the other thing that I'll mention is if you are not speaking, I'd encourage you to actually mute yourself because we all have background noise, you can me with the bark in the background, for example. So, feel free to mute yourself if you're not speaking and unmute yourself if you are speaking. Monique, I'm going to invite you to share your video, feel free to deny that if you don't want to but just to help you find that... Okay, there you go. Hi. So let me actually just plunge in and share a couple of things about Local Voices Network and then some really, I'm sorry, boring rights language at the beginning that we all have to listen to and say, I agree, to make sure that we're all on the same page and this is being recorded.", "4506": "So first of all, I'll just say again, welcome to the conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you so much for agreeing to participate in this conversation and thank you, Lynn, for facilitating as part of this mentoring in medicine conversation. I've begun recording at this time and I need to share just a little information with you before we begin our conversation. So following our conversation today, this video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation first, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policymakers, and members of the media and to this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation.", "4507": "The Local Voices Network conversations, as I mentioned, are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, this is not a focus group. Rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues, it's also not a town hall. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community rather than sharing any personal information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and others, other participants, and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "4508": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the Local Voices Network to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website or be broadcast on a local radio station or appear elsewhere including other forms of media. So please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say, I agree. So we are going to start from here.", "4509": "I agree.", "4510": "So we are going to start from here. [crosstalk 00:04:51].", "4511": "I agree.", "4512": "I agree.", "4513": "I agree.", "4514": "Each one of you individually say, I agree. So I'll pass it over to Lynn first to say I agree.", "4515": "Yes, I agree.", "4516": "And then we'll pass it to the next phase.", "4517": "Simone.", "4518": "I agree.", "4519": "And then if you could... Venice.", "4520": "I agree.", "4521": "Caron.", "4522": "I agree.", "4523": "Marilyn.", "4524": "I agree.", "4525": "Cheryl.", "4526": "I agree.", "4527": "Rosemary.", "4528": "I agree.", "4529": "And Monique.", "4530": "I agree.", "4531": "Great, okay.", "4532": "Thank you so much. We also just want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and to learn from others in this conversation. So before I hand it over to Lynn, I'm just going to go over a couple of guidelines that we'd like to introduce so that we're all on the same page. So first of all, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, that is key. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Number three, share the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns, sometimes hard in a Zoom conversation when you know who's speaking next, but we'll do our best. Number four, stay curious, ask honest questions. Number five, pause, take time for reflection, silence is not the enemy. And number six, listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. I'd also like to just remind everyone to close any unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone on board with these guidelines? And is there anything that you want to change?", "4533": "Okay, great. So I'm going to hand it over to our esteemed facilitator, Lynn. And I'm going to actually turn off my video because I won't be participating in this conversation. I'll be just listening in and helping with any technical issues if they come up. I'll also be playing a highlight later on in the conversation. So thank you all so much.", "4534": "Great. Thank you, Alex.", "4535": "Thank you.", "4536": "All right, everyone. So let's get started. So just want to make sure that everyone is on board with the guidelines that Alex mentioned and find out if there's anything you would like to add or change. Great. Let's take a deep breath in and out and let's get started. [inaudible] this virtual conversation, we are going to use a modified circle process where each person will take a turn and I posted that order in the chat, which I will now send. Let's see. Okay. Has everyone received that order?", "4537": "I see it.", "4538": "Yep.", "4539": "Yes? Okay, great.", "4540": "What number am I because it just gave me a quick blip and then it just went away?", "4541": "Okay. So who was that just speaking because I-", "4542": "That was Simone.", "4543": "Oh, Simone. Okay, Simone, you are third to go but I will call-", "4544": "Third to go, okay.", "4545": "Yeah. I will call on you before everyone is included in this lineup. Correct in the circle?", "4546": "Perfect.", "4547": "I have to be first?", "4548": "I'll help transition us from one person to the next and you can always pass or pass and ask for us to come back to you, okay?", "4549": "[inaudible 00:08:25].", "4550": "All right. Does anyone have any questions about this process?", "4551": "No.", "4552": "Okay. So to begin, we want to do a quick round of introductions. I know some people know each other and others don't. Please share with us your first name or a pseudonym, if you like. And in addition to your first name, a little bit of background info about who you are, for example, where you live or work and what you do, also a value that is important to you and how it is related to what brought you here today. So I'll start off, my name is Lynn Holden. Some of you, I know also I know some are new, but it's great to see everyone. Thank you again for participating. I live in New Rochelle, but I work in the Bronx.", "4553": "I'm an emergency medicine physician so it seems like I spend most of my time there actually. A value that is very important to me is, equality and it's related to what brought me here today because there are differences in the way that certain populations are treated when it comes to health, especially being magnified by this COVID-19 pandemic. So it is for me very important that we have health equality amongst our population. So that is what brought me here. I'll go to Rosemary next.", "4554": "Good evening, I'm usually not this quiet. So my name is Rosemary Rivera, I work also in Montefiore emergency medicine. I'm very well know, Dr. Holden she runs a Mentoring Medicine program, which I adore [inaudible] what she's doing. So I'm the building manager [inaudible 00:10:33]. So what's important to me is mental health, for me mental health [inaudible] because think it is important that we get away from the stigma, even though it has improved, but I think there is room for improvement where in our community so far has Hispanic and African American community, is that there is a stigma, you're crazy if you seek help. For me, something that is so hard, I used to work in the mental health field and I transition over to medical.", "4555": "I wish I never had done that because I think that mental health, understanding when there is a crisis before a person gets to the level that they need to be hospitalized, needs to be addressed even more. I know during COVID, there are commercials, there's phone numbers, but pre-COVID, where was it? You understand? Now it's available, which is good, but what is going to happen? Is it going to go back to silence? Is going to go back to mute? And I think that you brought this platform because it's something that also needs to be addressed also along with what Dr. Holden was saying.", "4556": "Thank you, Rosemary. I'm going to ask if you're not speaking, if you could mute yourself so that we don't hear the background noise, because it is being recorded and sometimes with background noise your voice can be drowned out. So, Caron you're next.", "4557": "Yeah. Hi, everyone. My name is Caron, I am an emergency medicine physician. I work at Montefiore in the Bronx, I've been there for over 20 years. I currently live in lower Westchester and a value that I cherish and I hold dear is resilience. I think it's very important for us as individuals to be resilient, and strong, and be able to bounce back from adversities especially during this critical time of, basically, craziness and profound death and stress and trauma that we're all going through. As a group, as a people, as a nation we need to gather all the strength that we can to bounce back and basically not let it get us down to the point where we're crippled. I think it's important for us to stand together and rally around and just show everyone that we can pull through this.", "4558": "Great, thank you. Simone, you're up next.", "4559": "Yes. Hi. My name is Simone Ford and I live in Jamaica, Queens, been here all my life, Queens. And my career path was I'm actually in the workforce and I work with workforce development. And when I was part of the workforce, I was known as the fairy job mother. So basically what that is, is that I eased and assist the hiring needs of employers all throughout and also assisted students, whether it's student... Anyone that needed a job, they came to me. One of my values through my, I would say, the three decades of being in the workforce and as I've learned as a person that has actually transitioned into disability because I also have what is called Rhupus. Rhupus is a combination of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus combined and it really did a number on my body. And I basically went through... I'm going to have my fourth surgery on my hands, as you see what Rhupus can do.", "4560": "So I have basically embraced as me being a person with a disability, but with that what values are important to me is a couple of things which leads to empathy, compassion, support, and access to support people that have that. We need proper leadership. Without that leadership, we're not going to have the accesses to people that are empathetic that can actually get something done. We're not going to have the access to the people that have compassion that can actually look into someone that's having a situation, that is going to a transition, whether they're identifying that they actually have a mental disability or mental illness or they have a physical disability that they have to mentally understand and know how to move forward with. So one of my values is again it starts with proper leadership and without that, we will not have the right access to the empathetic people, the compassionate, the support, and access to. Hopefully, that makes sense.", "4561": "Yes, it does.", "4562": "Okay.", "4563": "Thank you. Venice you're next.", "4564": "Good evening, I'm Venice Strawnsing. I've currently in a transitionary mode as far as employment. I've worked for Verizon for almost 30 years and I'm transitioning to another phase of my life seeking what really matters, living my values per se. So I've lived in the Bronx for most of my life and I appreciate the community. And community is basically the foundation of my values. With community, you're going to share, with a sense of community, you're going to help. When everyone is off by themselves, that's when you see the tragedies, that's when you see the stories, or we're so ashamed to share, we're so busy, we have our mask on pretending that everything is okay and we're not sharing and we're also not asking. So we're all caught up in our own world and we're missing the opportunity to be a community.", "4565": "My personal experience, I've had the health issues, I've had the mental health, I've had geriatric health issues with my parents. And how I've been able to make progress, to get help essentially, was through community. Moving beyond embarrassment and shame or feeling as if you're inadequate, as if you're not enough, and to start speaking about it. And speaking to the right people, just going back to what Simone said, you have to find someone who is empathetic because people will listen and move on. Okay, they have problems, but you have to find someone in the community, a leader who is a champion, who can be or champion and who can bring it to a place where we can get the help we need. So just to summarize the foundational value for me is community. This is an area right now that we are in, it represents... For me, I'm thrilled actually because this is our community and we get a chance to discuss the things that are important to our community. So I appreciate this opportunity and thank you.", "4566": "Thank you, Venice. I got it right this time, right? Okay, Marilyn, you're up next.", "4567": "Hi, I'm Marilyn, I live in the Bronx, I am a registered nurse, and I'm transitioning into education. I do currently teach nursing students and I'm in school to further my career. What's important to me, I think as a nurse, is education. I think the more educated somebody is the better they're able to function. When I say that I mean, especially my patients, I think as nurses or even in the community, we should have an outlet for them to go and to find out what's going on, how do I take care of my diabetes, how do I take care of my CHF, any questions I have in regards to maybe social work issues, you need to have someone in the community that they can reach out to. And I think education is key because a lot of times at work, patients will come to the hospital only because they weren't sure about something or they didn't get a good discharge information, so they come back. So that also increases our reimbursements and hospital stay and all that. So I personally think education in any aspect is key. And that's my value.", "4568": "Great. Thank you very much for that. Cheryl, hello.", "4569": "Hi. Yeah, so I'm Cheryl and I'm an anesthesiologist. I live in Queens and I actually work New Haven at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital. I used to work at Montefiore many years ago and this is where I am now. I would say that what I think is very important to me, and it was touched upon actually just a moment ago, is education. I think it empowers us, it's something that I put a lot of effort into not only education of patients but also in the community because it's empowering. And certainly with students, with our residents working in the hospital, nursing at all levels, I think it's extremely important to all of us. And that's where I put a lot of value because that does make a difference in not only how we can deal with the healthcare system and realize that the disparities exist, but by education it allows our patients and us to not only ask the right questions, advocate for our patients because we have that knowledge that empowers. And I certainly want to share that with patients and with trainees and others in my community.", "4570": "Great. Thank you, Cheryl. And Monique, hello.", "4571": "Hello. How is everyone today? Hope everybody's well. So my name is Monique Riley and I am from the Bronx. I am the CEO and founder of Freedom Youth LLC, Freedom Youth Family Justice Center, and The Bronx Teen Trafficking and Domestic Violence Task Force. What I think I value most, I'm also a survivor of human trafficking, what I value the most is advocacy and policy especially pertaining to those who have been victimized I think it's important that they are considered in all that we do pertaining to the health field, pertaining to education, pertaining to community, pertaining to partnerships. So I think that's where I truly find my value effect.", "4572": "Okay, thank you. Thank you, everyone, for sharing. We're going to move on, the next thing we would like to do is to invite you to share a bit about yourself. Since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing look like and feel like to you. Think of a time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. I'll give you a second for that and if you wish to opt-out you may do that. And remember to share, really, only what you comfortable with others knowing. The questions I'm going to ask you to answer are first of all, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel? So again, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel?", "4573": "So we will go round one at a time to share our stories. Again, please remember that this is being recorded so we ask that you not disclose any sensitive, personal health information or use the names of other people when telling your story. So I'll begin. I can say that I felt the healthiest in my life after I was recuperating from postpartum cardiomyopathy 22 years ago after I had my daughter. And I say that because at the time I can truly say that some of the factors that I had then, I was practicing for example meditation, regular exercise, I was on a strict schedule, my eating was better so those are some of the factors that really supported me.", "4574": "And I had a real sense of joy because I had survived something that some people did not. Some females who had the same disease we're unfortunately not as fortunate to survive and if they did, not to need a heart transplant. So I had a sense of joy about surviving and I had factors that really enhanced wellness and wellbeing with the meditation, the strict exercise, and the strict dietary regimen that I was following. So we're going to start with Rosemary. You're on mute. Oh, you're on mute. Okay, got you.", "4575": "So I was at my best 22 years ago and the reason that I say that I was at my best health-wise and mentally because by that time, I had gotten my life back, I felt free, and I claimed what was mine because I'm a survivor of domestic violence. So it was important to me was taken from me, slowly at a time, but I was able to get it back. So for me to get my life back, go back into the work field, provide a stable environment for children was very important and that started 20 years ago. So that's where I was at my best.", "4576": "Great, thank you. Caron.", "4577": "Yes, hi. Honestly, I have to say I think I'm at my best now. And I say that... Or at least for the past two years. And I say that because I'm actually able to... For the first time, I feel free mentally. I went through a pretty horrendous divorce a couple of years ago and I believe that has centered me where I am mentally at my best. I've made changes in my diet, with the support of my family I am able to basically go on with life and feel more enriched, I feel like my soul is at its best, and I am incorporating meditation lately in my life, which I believe is very helpful and useful because I chronically am fatigued from chronic insomnia. So it's helped me settle a lot of things that I've been dealing with. So I have to say currently I'm at my best and I am striving to do better as the days go on and yeah, that's it.", "4578": "Okay, thank you. Simone.", "4579": "Yes. I would say that right now, as a young lady prior to me, I'm on the road to being the best. I have served over three decades in the workforce development either assisting employers with their hiring needs or finding many jobs for job seekers with the organization, how can I say this? So I've basically, for the past, I would say, three years, coming into terms with my disability impacting my daily quality of life. And understanding where it started to impact my professional life. Thinking that because I've done so much and given so much without asking for anything in return that my work environment would not only support me but accommodate me, that did not happen. I identified that my employer really was not going to and they basically blatantly did not. I don't want to go too much and I want to be strategic on how I say this, but it came down to a point where it was blatant. And when I stood up for myself because I knew my rights and I knew what was supposed to be owed to me as an employee that has a disability, I was retaliated against.", "4580": "So with that said, I put the loyalty to the job and I sacrificed my health. When I know I had to be at certain doctor's appointments, I let that slip because either I didn't have the time or I just didn't make the time. When I started to realize that I had certain rights and I needed to really take that balance because my health... Again, Rhupus is a double and learning about it I'm like, okay, I really need to start paying attention to my health. So when I started to pay attention to my health and trying to get the accommodations and the support, I wasn't getting it from my job.", "4581": "So now I'm in a state where I've started to look forward to taking care of my health more, learning more. I'm no longer part of the workforce but I have made every doctor's appointment, I've gone to my occupational therapist the way I'm supposed to, I'm eating better, I'm sleeping better, I grew 26 inches of hair that I actually wore out first today because I was wearing wigs because I said, wow, I'm actually being able... I'm drinking water, I was never a water person, and now I'm in control of the Rhupus. I'm thinking that there was a balance, I can do both. But again, as I said, what value when you don't have proper leadership, you don't have those vessels of empathy, you do not have those vessels of compassion, you do not have those vessels of support, you do not have access to that. So people like me that still try to be part of the workforce cannot be because I was in an entity that did not help me balance. So now I had to make the choice of just taking care of me. So that's, yeah.", "4582": "Okay, thank you. Thank you for sharing that. Venice, you're next.", "4583": "I'll just step away for a minute to turn the light up because I feel like I'm fading into the darkness. So give me one sec.", "4584": "I'm starting to feel like Diana Ross from 1985, this is a lot of stuff. I have got to tie it up because I'm feeling like the Central Park Diana Ross. It is a lot and it's all natural-too, that's the thing, it's hot.", "4585": "Thank you. Good, good.", "4586": "Okay, yeah. That's a little better.", "4587": "Venice. Yes, do speak now, yes.", "4588": "So this is a little tough for me [inaudible 00:34:26]. This was a little tough for me, I believe I've had ebbs and flows. But I'd say right now, not being chained to a clock anymore, taking a leap of faith and stepping away from... Your employment, you need to work in order to survive. But having had time to think, I've realized how much every aspect of my life was impacted with how much I poured into this place of employment and there was no passion. So it was just year after year of very tedious existence. Now that I've stepped away, yes I need to find new employment, but I'd say my health is the best it's been in years. Being in our current situation, I have moments where it gets sad like everyone else, I can't go outside the way I want to, but there's not the sense of being on a treadmill, there's not the sense of I don't own anything of me, I belong to everybody else but [inaudible 00:36:02].", "4589": "And I've had time to think, I've had time to, after 28 years, of realizing who I am and what I truly want to do with my life. And physical health is mental health so even as the body ages, for me, my mind is sharper than it's been in years. And I want to do things for myself and I can think complete thoughts, which is quite an accomplishment, I can write a whole paragraph. Because when you work a certain way, where it's bits and bytes and send an email here and move on to the next, you're always in a state of fight or flight where every time the phone rings literally feel your heart rate go up. That's not healthy, that's not what I lived for a long time.", "4590": "So I feel better these days and it's a result of making that change. Yes, there are times I get anxious because I have children to educate. So I get anxious about how is this going to happen financially. But I can garden for hours and not check my phone and not care because if my kids need me, they'll call grandma's phone. So it's a certain sense of peace in spite of. And that's where I am right now.", "4591": "Nice. Thank you for sharing that Venice. I'm going to ask again to everyone if you're not speaking mute yourself because we are being recorded with the conversation. So next we have Marilyn.", "4592": "Okay, let's see. Currently, I think professionally, I'm at my best. I am actually doing what I love to do, I like getting up in the morning, going to work, taking care of patients, educating students, that's my thing, I feel good that way. Physically, I am not at my best, I need to lose some weight and stick with it. Like say, if I want to do something, I have a regimen, I need to find that regimen that's going to be comfortable for me to do and not for me just to stop and then start and stop and start and stop and start. So that's my issue right now is to lose some weight because the older I get, the aches and pains are more now, my knees and all that. So physically I don't feel 100% thus I'm not at my best but mentally and professionally, I think I'm good right now.", "4593": "Just a quick question. Do you remember when you did feel your best and what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellbeing then?", "4594": "Oh, when I did feel my best was I think when I graduated with my masters, I felt my best then. And what was the other question, Lynn? What did you say?", "4595": "So what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? And what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at that time and how did you feel?", "4596": "Well, I was probably 30 pounds lighter. I'm not a big person like that, I was probably 30 pounds lighter. And I accomplished degree that I never thought I would actually go into nursing because I actually worked with Verizon before for 19 years, I've worked with Venice actually. And I never thought that I would find something that makes me feel fulfilled as a profession and so going farther in it to get my masters, that was a major accomplishment for me. And I never stopped there, now I'm working on my doctorate and I am confident that I will get that too. And then I think when I do get that, I will reach my self-actualization, I guess. But in terms of health-wise, mentally I'm okay, physically, I need to work on that.", "4597": "Okay, great. Thank you very much for that, Cheryl.", "4598": "Yes. Hi. So, thinking back on life and we all have these experiences. I would say there was a point in my life where I was dealing with a lot of challenges and it was difficult to figure out the path that I needed to follow. So I started to try to decide in my mind what did I really need, what was really missing from my life? And I would say what really helped, and I would say is probably the best health and wellbeing that occurred at that moment in time, was when I made the decision to seek religious and spiritual support. And that made all the difference in my life.", "4599": "And I would say from that moment in time, which was maybe about 15, 16 years ago, I've been so much stronger in my abilities to move forward with life, to do many other things with my life. It just gave me a little different perspective on life in general. And I learned about helping others, doing more for others, and also taking care of myself. And I do believe that I can pinpoint it to returning to church because I had left church and you can get busy with other things in life and you realize that you need to go back to that. And once I did that, I've been a different person and much stronger.", "4600": "Thank you, Cheryl, for sharing that. And Monique, we didn't forget you.", "4601": "Hi. I would say the last time that I felt... Well, I'll say that now. I will say now I feel a whole lot more whole. As a survivor, you through a lot of trauma. I started my organizations in 2019 and I've been sharing a lot more of my story. But what it did, it allowed me to have a space of just to be able to share and release. So each time that I get the opportunity to share my story, I felt that this great weight that would just fall off bit by bit. And so I think right now I'm at my best professionally, mentally I'm working towards it, and I'm also on a little bit of a diet to lose weight. So I think that's where I'm at right now with everything.", "4602": "Okay, great. Thank you. All right, we want to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly and share about either your neighborhood community or your social or work community. So some of us here don't actually live in New York City but we work in New York City so we want to focus on that as our community. When you are responding to questions, if you are speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you are thinking of when you share your story.", "4603": "I've got a few questions to start us off but we hope that this will be a time for some back and forth among you as you share your stories. I invite you to respond to points that resonate with you, for you when they are made by others in the group while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so. So if you feel that you would like to add to what someone says, if it resonates with you, if you could just raise your hand because I know all of us we're new to Zoom so if you just raise your hand, I'll be able to see that.", "4604": "So let's go with the first question. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you, to your, or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us to understand this a little better. So again, what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you, to your, or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us to understand this a little bit better. So we'll start off with Rosemary. Oh, you're on mute.", "4605": "I'm going to have to pass and come back to me.", "4606": "Okay.", "4607": "I'm trying to think, okay?", "4608": "Okay. Caron. So what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you or your community health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us to understand this a little better.", "4609": "Okay, I got it.", "4610": "You want us to go back to Rosemary's?", "4611": "Yeah.", "4612": "Yeah.", "4613": "Okay.", "4614": "So what I see my community it's very close and I live in the Bronx up north, Hutchinson Parkway. We have a very active community. One of the thing is the community board that meet once a week on Wednesdays, once a month, I'm sorry, the first Wednesday of the month. And we invite further up and we have one of the officers from the 52nd precinct that comes and he takes notes of all our concerns of what's going on in the community. And I know there's two particular people in my community who are very proactive in our community they have concerns. If there's anything that's going on that affects the children, they keep us aware of who's coming into our community with our past histories. I'm I answering, this is the correct question or is it... I'm I answering to the question because I don't want to be lost with it?", "4615": "Right, No. So again the question is what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? And what are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and wellbeing?", "4616": "So I'm going to have to say it's ,of course, the neighborhood and my neighbors. Also the community affairs officers from the 52nd precinct, they do come to our board meetings, they do listen to our concerns regarding anything new that's going on in the neighborhood, whether it is somebody new trying to come in and when they do illegal things, they're very well involved, and they also enforce anything that's going on. They do promote for us to, of course, I don't know what it's called, I think it citizens concern. We all support one another, we all take care of one another.", "4617": "One of the things about COVID, as a community we all came together. And in all my life that I lived in the Bronx, this was the first time that I saw everybody going out knocking on doors, offices were coming from the 52nd precinct and I do commend them a lot for assisting us and helping us and also wanting to know who in our building was elderly, what can we do regarding their health. Ourselves also were walking around knocking on doors checking to see if everyone was okay. And I think that what helps me with the community is the constant push that... This was lady, she also works at Montefiore, she is the matriarch of the community cats, dogs, you name it. She's there with a little bag, she wants to take care of everybody. And [inaudible] comment because she pushes for everybody to [inaudible 00:49:44].", "4618": "This is not just one person's community, this is not just about your health, this is not about just my wellbeing, this is a community, we all live here, we all have to take care of it. And with everything that you hear about police officers, one thing I can say, and I speak for myself, is the community affairs from the 52nd precinct do care. This is what they have shown me, I'm going to speak from my experience working with them, I don't go to meetings all the time because I have my own meetings that I go to like my own services that I go to, so sometimes that interferes, but then I'm also informed. This is very important. We learned a lot, I speak for myself, and I've learned a lot through COVID, I'm always [inaudible] with community, I'm almost always hands-on with people.", "4619": "But I think even more so in this instance, of course, fear came on and I think what pushes when you have your community by your side, when you have people come out of nowhere and want to help you, [inaudible 00:50:55], but it's been a very... I commend the community that I live in, the people, the activists, the lady, she works at Montefiore, God bless her, that pushes us to continue to go forward, to continue to help each other, to continue to support each other whether it's health, mental being, going to the hospital, she is the matriarch of the whole community I have to say.", "4620": "Thank you, Rosemary. Warmed up now.", "4621": "No, I think I participated and started writing, that's when you were talking, I was like, what is she saying? Okay, thank you.", "4622": "Thank you. Caron, you're ready?", "4623": "I am ready, but Lynn, can you come back to me after Simone? Because the door bell just rang, I have to step away for a minute. I'll be right back.", "4624": "Okay, no problem. Okay, Simone.", "4625": "So what I can say, Oh.", "4626": "Yeah, we can hear you.", "4627": "Oh, okay. Oh, I didn't know, can you see me?", "4628": "Yes.", "4629": "Oh, okay. Now I can see you. So basically what my community... I live in Rochdale Village and one of the things that this community has given me and I can actually show you, so this is from my terrace and if you see there's a park, you see it? It's outside park.", "4630": "Yeah.", "4631": "And I go out there every morning just to do the walk and I go on whatever... It's closed now because they don't want us, everything with COVID. But the community has allowed this serenity space for me. So this is one of the things that helps, again with me, just clearing out my mind, praying, whatever I need to do, take a little walk because I have a rescue bunny, his name is Stud Muffin, so we go and do a little walk around. But also with this... They have a 24-hour security, which is great, here. There's a pharmacy here that I basically... My pharmacist for 20 something years, over 25 years and he was very much, took care of everything, very personable. I lost him the COVID and that was one of the biggest hits because I lost one of my physicians. He took care of my medicines, he would advocate it for me, even if I didn't have the money he would make sure I had my medication. So I'm still traumatized over that.", "4632": "But the pharmacy, we have our pharmacies, we have... It's just safety and I would not be anywhere else within Queens because it's just about, we have close by the police precinct. But I have some issues stemmed from almost 30 years ago with the same precinct. Here it is I'm in the area that is zoned for, but many years ago officers from this precinct snatched up my brother in front of his house for no apparent reason and how this is all coming about. My brother had the similar situation too, he got out because he talked up. They picked him, he was in front of the house and out of nowhere a squad car came, snatched him, put him in a car, didn't even tell him why he was whatever. They rode around with him and he was asking and he talked up saying, who are you, whatever and basically they let him go. But it's like, wow, how everything is turning around now, how I remember that.", "4633": "But yeah, just the serenity. They have here senior citizen groups and centers here. If you're over 60, if you have over a certain age and if you're in need, or if you're disabled, shut-in, they have trucks or vans, they'll come by and do wellness checks for people that are in need, so that's what I love about this here. They have little festivals here for the community to come around and do barbecues, little sales bakes, they have galas, we have what is called a community center here. So if I do choose to use my golden years through here, I'm good because they have everything here for if you're transitioning, they have schools for children here, yeah, it's a good neighborhood, very good community here.", "4634": "Caron didn't come back? Wow, there she is.", "4635": "So, as I said earlier, I live in lower Westchester but I lived in the Bronx for many, many years when I immigrated from Jamaica to this country, so I'm very familiar and my family also they're still there in the Bronx, so I'm always in the Bronx, I work in the Bronx, so the Bronx is like community to me. So the things that from a physician standpoint and working at a hospital that primarily cares for underserved population in the Bronx, we've done a tremendous amount to improve the health and close the gap of disparities in and around the hospital. They have been, over the past few months I believe, opened up an urgent care center close by the hospital, which I believe is great. There've been a number of urgent cares that Montefiore has partnered with to increase the access of healthcare for patients who might not want to deal with long wait times coming to the emergency department. So it's was just another way of accessing healthcare, which I think is important. So that I believe has been a tremendous improvement.", "4636": "Also, we have had multiple, multiple programs stemming from the hospital out into the community where we go into patient's homes to basically offer care, check up on them, wound care, blood pressure check, basically, in-home education, nutrition education, to basically improve the quality of care of patients, and also to instruct them on how to use basic things such as inhalers just to avoid readmissions to the emergency department. So with all these programs I believe have proved very helpful and again, is put in place to decrease that inequality and disparity gap.", "4637": "From a personal standpoint, even though I don't currently live in the Bronx, but I'm always in the Bronx, the things that I've seen, my sons, I have two boys, so I'm always taking them to the barber in the Bronx. So that barbershop basically, I have witnessed a couple of times where they've had healthcare providers come in and just do local blood pressure checks, which I believe is paramount in educating and making some of these social determinants of health, bring it to the forefront and making people aware of things that they need to pay attention to, which is things like their blood pressure, their diabetes, how to take care of it. So there's some education being done on the basic level of going to a barbershop. So I think that's great.", "4638": "The other thing is we've had a couple of family friends who have utilized senior facilities down there like off Boston road and the Bronx, a well known road in the Bronx, we've had family members spend hours and hours there. My mom suffers from Alzheimer's and my only hope was that she would be able to partake in activities such as that, but unfortunately, she can't. But it is a big asset to others who are able to get involved. So those are some of the basic things that I've seen around the general vicinity where I work and where I visit. And again, they're things that are happening and they're positive.", "4639": "Nice. Thank you. Venice.", "4640": "I will say that for me, what contributed to my health and wellbeing, what's worked well is being a part of the church. There's a fire engine going by because that's part of being in the Bronx. There's... Wait a second until it goes by. Okay. So the church is an integral part of this community, the church has been there when there was nothing else. So I've seen where there have been people who can't pay their rent and don't qualify for services based on their immigration status and the church has fed them, the church has paid their rent, the church has taken care of their children's clothing and such. And that's the church at its best. I'm trying to stay on a positive note, but I have seen where the church has not been there because the dependency has been let's go to the church. Again, it's a cultural thing. So this is where we're familiar and we go to the church and folks in the church are not professionals, we have the spiritual aspect, the spiritual man being fed or woman, but when you require real services and real health, social services, it's not there.", "4641": "And that's happened to me where there was... It was a big let down for me in my journey. And just having had the time to think about it, you create your community, that's where I am. You create what you want, it's no one's fault that this isn't working. You have to get up and go find it, so that's what I've been doing. I've been attending community board meetings when I can, as Rosemary said, I've made myself known to the NCO, the neighborhood officers at the 47th precinct. They know me, I have their number is my cell phone and I call them. So when I get frustrated with what's not working well, I have to step back because I find that I've had to create my own path. And it's not tooting my own horn, I've found that I became so frustrated and depressed, just depressed about garbage on my street, just old cars, derelict vehicles, where I have a neighbor who he's running a car business on the block.", "4642": "And I've had to become my own advocate to the point where I was instrumental in getting speed humps installed on my street, collecting signatures, walking the street, getting rejected. So it's been a work for me. I've had to create my own wellbeing and it's still in progress because I've seen where the streets are getting dirtier. And I've literally been out there with my bag and my picker picking up other people's trash, but I live here and I want my neighborhood to be a certain way, my community to be a certain way, so I've found that I've had to step out of waiting for them. Somebody else needs to do this, somebody needs to take care of this, well, I'm that body now, I'm the one making it work, I'm the one calling 311 as often as I can to say this vehicle is still there. And I'm the one attending the meetings every opportunity there is so the officers know me and they know my problem and they even text me and say there's a meeting coming up please come. So for me, that's quite an accomplishment.", "4643": "So it's been a struggle. I'd like to say being here has made, I don't want to say wellbeing, it's been a struggle. But again, as I said, I can't stay here, I can't stay in this space and complain anymore because that gets us nowhere. So I've lived in the Bronx for most of my life, I've seen the community, the physical community now not sense of community, and even that too where people are more trying to do their own thing and ignoring the trash and ignoring don't go to meetings, but complain and we go to church every Sunday and we pray and we clap and then we walk out and step over the trash and go back home.", "4644": "So that doesn't work for me anymore and I've actually started reaching out to assemblymen and meeting people, I went to a rally, I met the borough president the other day. So I'm getting in the face of the people who I believe will restore what I believe is deteriorating very quickly for me. Because if my streets are dirty then my sense of wellbeing is not there because I can't step over trash and lock my door and pretend I didn't see it. So that's where I stand.", "4645": "Okay, thank you for sharing that. Thank you. Marilyn, I believe you're up next. You're on mute.", "4646": "Well, I'm going to be honest. I go to work and I come home and I'm not involved in the community however. I feel safe here right now compared... I don't know. We haven't had any break-ins or anything, no trash on the street, Venice, maybe some areas up in Allerton, maybe. But I just go to work, go and come home, I don't really... Maybe I need to change that and get more involved and find out where the community board meetings are and all that. Now, listening to you guys, that's making me feel like, yes, I need to do something. There's no cops that come and knock on my door unless there's a crime on the block. So you're right, maybe I should seek out the information about what's going on in the community because it's important because it will affect us.", "4647": "I do, however, see... I like the bike tracks they have a lot of bike tracks at Allerton so I see a lot of people ride in the parks, I see a lot of people in the parks, which is good, that means it's safe. I see, coming home in the evenings at seven, eight o'clock I see people and going in the mornings, I see people so more than likely it's safe, I haven't heard of any incidences. I have a neighbor across the street, she's like a... What do you call that? What do you call those people? She sees and hears everything, what do you call those people?", "4648": "Night watch monitors.", "4649": "Yes, right. She is [crosstalk] so I don't need... I am good, she will let me know. Even yesterday she said, \"Did you get any mail today?\" And I said, \"No.\" because since the COVID we've been not getting our mail. And I said, \"No.\" She says, \"Hmm, I'm going to make a call.\" Or something like that. But I am going to definitely make it for this year as soon as COVID dies down, hopefully it does, to get more involved in the community because I also do think that as healthcare practitioners, it's good for us to actually give back by maybe going to church and giving lessons or giving information on health or lifestyle change or even if you have a disease process, we can actually help out in the church. Maybe I should start to do that, I should.", "4650": "Okay. And I move on to Cheryl. Thank you, Marilyn.", "4651": "So what I would say works well in my Queens neighborhood, and I'm talking specifically on my block, are the great neighbors that I have. And a lot of them are retired so they tend to be those who keep a watch out, anything looks suspicious, they're going to investigate, maybe not go outside, but they're watching from their window. And they really support the rest of us who may be going out to work each day. But I can tell you when I have time, I will go shop for them, if I'm off a day and they need to go for a doctor's appointment, they may say, hey, are you available today? Can you help us? And I'll take them to a doctor's appointment. In the middle of the night if they're not feeling well, they may give me a call and say, whoever it is, I'm not feeling well, can you just come by to check up on me?", "4652": "So I do those things and they, in turn, help out and help one another. When we have snow on the ground, another neighbor will be helping out to shovel the snow, that kind of thing. So we all look out for each other and it works well. So I would say that's really what provides me with great support living on that block and having such great neighbors around me.", "4653": "Great. Thank you, Cheryl. And Monique.", "4654": "Yes. I also wanted to add to that. Well, piggyback off that. I believe the community, the neighbors that we have, as well as the organizations that we have in my neighborhood here in the Bronx, [inaudible] Fordham. And we have some really great organizations and clinics as well, such as Union Community Health Center, Montefiore Community Board Seven that has really helped me to get out there as well and try to speak more about my own trauma. Also, I will say that I have five children so the park has been really great for us to be able to go out and congregate there and release. That's what I wanted to say.", "4655": "Okay.", "4656": "Yes.", "4657": "All right. Let's talk a little bit about this pandemic. So what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in the pandemic that you would like for others to understand? If you could share a brief story from your experience that will help us to understand this a little better. I know Rosemary, we're going to start off with you, but you already mentioned how your neighbors have seemed to come together and check on the elderly in your building. Can you talk [inaudible] or any other aspect of resiliency in the pandemic that you've noticed? Oh, you're on mute again.", "4658": "Well, the resiliency in the community as I shared and our neighborhood has always come together, but I do want to acknowledge the workforce. Does it have to be the community, Dr, Holden?", "4659": "Well, your community broadly. So if the workforce is part of your community in the Bronx, then that's important too.", "4660": "Yes, that is important. What I see is in the workplace, what the pandemic has done, how it brought people closer, but I just want to say that the providers that we work for and that ED showed such resilience in how they came together, how they work together, how they supported each other, how they uplifted one another, we can see it all the time. But when you saw how... I can't even explain it. It was something beautiful, it's something that made you cry, it was something that took on your heart. And one of the young ladies talked about empathy, sympathy, all those beautiful quantities evolve and show with the emotions of this pandemic in the workforce. Even outside the community, not just in my community, you saw that everywhere that you walked. You saw fear, but you also saw people uplifting and holding each other up. You saw people just being kind and just the humanity behind it was beautiful.", "4661": "And with our providers, even though... And the nursing, everyone was tired, but you couldn't tell with the energy and the resilience that they had to push for and getting through this tough trial time that they were going through in the front end. And what they saw on the patients of course, how did they handle it? You couldn't tell that they were going through something because all they cared was making sure that they took care of patients, you understand? And that's something that has impacted me working where I work at, with the providers that I do work with, with the support staff that we do have, whether it was inside, outdoor, from the essential workers in the Bronx, from the people who work in the cafeteria, from engineering to transporting, for everybody, it was just like we were all intertwined together, you understand? And nothing's could have let us go.", "4662": "And that is something that through the trust formed to the tears, through the hardship, through being tired, through being emotionally drained, mentally, and physically, where now you also saw something beautiful. You saw unity, you saw strength, you saw support, you understand? You saw empathy, sympathy. There was so much that went into it that it was something beautiful and I know it's something that will continue. It had an impact on me in where I live at, where I work at, and when I used to walk outside. So it was just all around me, positive or negative, but I focus more on the good that I saw in people. And also what helped was also my Lord Jesus, my faith, and behind my faith, there was hope [inaudible 01:16:59].", "4663": "Thank you, Rosemary, thank you. Caron.", "4664": "Uh, yes. Hi. So I echo everything that Rosemary just said. It was absolutely 100% dead on what she just said that occurred during the pandemic, during the past couple of months. But I also want to say, we talk a lot about us as healthcare providers being resilient and pulling through and helping each other through this pandemic, this trauma but I want to say kudos, I want to put my thumbs up to the community at large. When I say community at large, I'm talking about New York as a whole, New York City, and their response. A lot of them, they went through the trauma, they were the ones that lost family members, they were the ones that had family members dying in the hospital and weren't able to be there and to have closure and even have the ability to bury their loved ones. Yet what I saw and what was profound to me was the amount of outpouring of love that the community showed to us, the healthcare providers, over the past couple of months, it was heartwarming.", "4665": "Every day, single day, there was a delivery to the emergency department from the neighborhood pizza shop or the grocery down the street. They were delivering things to us, they were calling us, they were saying thank you. Just coming home, even though I don't live in New York City per se but I border New York City, so even coming home, maybe because I have my scrubs on half the time, people are just waving, saying thank you, showing appreciation for everything that we did and everything that we went through. And I find that as a community, that it brought the best out of everyone. And I still sense that it still continues, it's a little overshadowed by some of the other things that are going on with the protest that we had. But it's very evident and I have to say it's great to be a New Yorker right now.", "4666": "Yeah, thank you. I will echo, I remember coming out of the hospital and seeing just all these accolades on the sidewalk with different colors of chalk [crosstalk] thank you, your community loves you, all these hearts, and the fire department would come around and they would come en masse with EMS and they would just stand there and just clap. So it really helped us to say okay, let's continue, let's go back in there. And so I agree that was very heartwarming. Okay, Simone.", "4667": "Tell me the question again because I had to step away to get my battery.", "4668": "Oh, okay. So the question is, what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to [inaudible] share a brief story us?", "4669": "When we stuck together especially with... Start with my floor, I have some seniors. I can't do too much, especially with my hands being the way, because I'm still post-surgery with my hands. But whatever I was able to do, especially I have senior citizens that are on my floor, I do check-in. One of the things around here in the community, the community board member would send out flyers in case if someone needed stuff, they made partnerships with Catholic charities for when people that were in need that couldn't get food, they're doing the deliveries now. The, what was it? The grocery store had, for the people that were like myself that are compromised health-wise, they gave certain hours, like four hours just for the people to shop, they became very creative. Especially, I have my neighbor, she knew I couldn't go be around a lot of people because one of the things about Rhupus, it attacks the lungs so I have issues with that, she goes shopping for me. We look out for each other.", "4670": "That's one of the things is I have my own family on my own floor, we look out for each other and just being creative. The education about how COVID has spread, trying to, for the, I won't say, the wisdom, I'm part of the wisdom generation, I'm the junior because I would say the wisdom is, I would say, 75 and up. But the wisdom generation now has to continuously have to talk to the younger generation about how this thing is spread and the selfishness has to really be thought of and where they're going. Because you still have some of these 20-year-olds and some of the 30-year-olds and they're still walking around with no mask.", "4671": "So if I see them in the hallway or in the elevator and I watched them grow up, I pull them aside and say do you need a mask? Now, I'll get you one. Now, I know these ones if you're all about your fashion statement, we can just put a Chanel sign on it and then call it a day. But other than that, you want to put the next time I see you're going to have on a mask because now you're messing with me. If I'm getting on an elevator with you, you're putting me at risk. So it's just about that old school, it takes a village, you know how your neighbor would tell you if you were doing something wrong? It's like we have to start that back again because this generation, their heads are harder than a titanium ship, they don't want to listen. They'll still go, even if you tell them this can kill you, they still want to just YOLO thing. No, you want to do YOLO, or do you want to do a coffin? Which one?", "4672": "So it's just the pandemic has really put me in a place where I've been talking to God a lot since my transition with my health. But this pandemic I started, when I speak with people what comes in my head. And maybe everyone will probably... If everyone saw The Color Purple, has anyone seen The Color Purple, the movie?", "4673": "Yeah.", "4674": "Remember when Shug, when they went in the juke-joint and Shug's father, which was the preacher, had the sermon and she busted into the sermon the song, God is trying to tell you something. When the pandemic hit, that song kept coming in my spirit and I kept playing it every night because I'm like this pandemic took away my pharmacist, it took away my godfather, it took away up to 17 people that I know. So I'm like, okay, God is trying to tell you something. So God is trying to tell us something when he, basically, took the whole world into a halt. And it's made me a lot more in tune to my spirit because he says, okay, I'm taking away your job, you don't have to go to work, you don't have to travel. I'm taking away all other things now that I've restricted you from even going outside, you got my attention? So that's the way I see it's like God is trying to tell us something, he wants all of our attention because by doing this, he's trying to tell us something.", "4675": "And 2020, I'm like, okay, I've been listening but I'm full attention now because now you're taking away people out of my life. And I'm like, okay, what's the message? What's the word? What do I need to do moving forward? How do I... And I feel like I've always been a great person, but what can I do to be better? How am I to be a vessel to someone? What can I do? It's just being a better person and just being a vessel, sharing my story, sharing my history, the empathy, the compassion, the support, the access to, who can I share that with and add that to? So, yeah.", "4676": "Okay, thank you for sharing that. Thank you, Simone. Venice.", "4677": "I will acknowledge the contribution of the healthcare professionals and I'm talking about the physician right down to the person mopping the floor. I cannot imagine being in that situation, leaving your families and their families and going. It's like you're walking into the Colosseum that's the analogy that came to me when I saw the healthcare workers going to work. It's like they're going into the-", "4678": "Gladiators.", "4679": "Yeah, that's what I saw, it was like you're going in there. And I was incredibly moved by the commitment everywhere, not just my community, but just the sacrifice. It wasn't just a paycheck and I honor and respect that tremendously. That's it.", "4680": "Thank you, Venice. Cheryl. Oh, wait, wait, hold it, I'm sorry, Marilyn first and then Cheryl.", "4681": "So I have a lot of echos here because I do work at Montefiore so what and Caron said and Rosemary was so true, being at work every day and dealing with the unknown and every day you go home you wonder, am I going to wake up with a fever? It was traumatizing. But what I did to make myself whole, or keep myself focused, I created a group with my girlfriends and we meet every two weeks. And that's how I've been able to deal through the whole COVID thing. That really helped out a lot by hearing others' experiences, having Lynn or Caron or whoever's on that panel in the group answer questions because I think talking about... Sometimes you're home and you're depressed or you're stressed out, but just having the other person to talk to, it helps out a lot. And even if they could take your mind away from COVID and we talk about something else, so that's helped out.", "4682": "In the neighborhood here though, I must say that I'm a stigma for mask, and every day I drive up and down the street, Allerton everywhere, I see people with their mask, so I feel pretty safe here. Even though the numbers are saying that my zip code Pelham Gardens was pretty high in terms of the infection rate, everybody had their mask on and I feel comfortable when I go. Like today I went to the carwash and then to the store, so people are complying. So as Caron said, being a New Yorker, I don't want to be in any other state right now than here. And we just have to continue to do what we're doing, we got over it to a point we just... I do have friends who lost loved ones. Thank, God I haven't lost anybody in my immediate family or anything. But yeah, COVID has enlightened me a lot with a lot of other things too.", "4683": "Okay, thanks. Cheryl.", "4684": "So what I've learned about my community and more specifically about my block, my neighborhood is how strong we are as a community looking out for one another. It just showed the strength that we have, we're a tough group, the resilience is there. And I think that really made me proud to know that I live in such a community where we look out for one another, calling each other particularly, our senior citizens who weren't coming out and you couldn't really go to their house, but you could certainly give them a call and say, hey, how are you doing? Can I get something from the supermarket for you? So those kinds of things. And I have to say about my community in particular, we're a community that had to go to work. So we didn't have the luxury of being able to work from home, but we were out there and we did what we had to do. And thank goodness we've all been healthy and have made it through.", "4685": "Thank you. And Monique.", "4686": "Yes. So what I would like to say about my community is that I felt like we were really stronger and better together. We saw that through people gathering together to help out with the homeless, making sure that they were safe during the riots, making sure that they had a shelter, someplace to stay at. Unfortunately, my household was hit with COVID-19 twice. My husband worked at Montefiore Hospital in Mount Vernon and he is one of the security guys there and he had it back to back. When he got it the first time, we could not get any services. We didn't drive, so we couldn't go to a drive-thru. And it took maybe up to six weeks before we found out that he was absolutely COVID-19 positive. We have five kids, there was nothing put in place at the time for us to be able to split away from our children. Our children are ages from six to 17 years old. And so our kids were helping out younger kids, the older ones were helping the younger kids to be able to get online and do some of the education work they had to do.", "4687": "But what I would say about the community is that we band together, I did see that. We stick together and we made sure that our elderly was fed. When I finally came out of quarantine, I was able to create the vulnerable people project. And this project was because there were many people that were hungry, they were lacking food, and so on and so forth. And because I deal with people who are participating in survival sex, through prostitution, we were able to provide our partially funding for rent because a lot of the women were calling us and saying that their landlords were propositioning them for sex. So we were able to take some of that load off of them. Yes, we did a whole NYU research together.", "4688": "Wow.", "4689": "Yes, it was horrible. And I'll be willing to share that with you guys maybe afterwards, but we have a research survey that shows there's a lot of vulnerable women during this who experienced domestic violence, they were partaking survival sex for the first time. And so we were able to take some of the load off by providing the basic needs, laundry soap for those who might not have laundry money and things of that nature. So I think that we saw that there was a problem, there was an issue and we definitely wanted to be able to help and a lot of people pulled together to make sure to happened. Rather, it was virtual training, online, keeping the kids business through virtual classes from Zoom, whatever. We were out there, other organizations were out there, grassroots organizations providing home-cooked meals. So I think that this community we definitely band together.", "4690": "Great. Thank you, Monique. And I think you're giving us a voice to a population that we often don't see because of various social reasons. So thank you for your insight into that. Let's see, I think we can... We're almost at the home stretch, ladies, so I want to definitely be respectful of your time and we will be finished by eight. Alex, I know you have a videotape. So now we're going to bring in the voice of someone who participated in conversations recently with the Local Voices Network. I want you to imagine that this person is actually in the room with us or on Zoom and listen closely to their comments. Then I'll invite you to share any responses and insights you have gained from listening to these comments. And Alex will cue-", "4691": "The first things that come to mind just for the sake of time is just change, like a systemic change in the way that we do things. From a top-down level, from the big guys up there that make the decisions to the ones that employ the services, just making sure that there is no question that there is socioeconomics and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels and that it affects our health. And if we can do away with that, where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals across the board, that if I'm walking down corona in my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan, like there's going to be no change, same quality of care there. That's the first thing that pops up.", "4692": "Okay, so would anyone like to share what insights, reactions, or memories come to mind from listening to that brief excerpt? So-", "4693": "Yeah, I can share some testimonies because where I live, I have to go in order for my healthcare, whether it's my rheumatologists, my pulmonologist, my general care practitioner, I have to go all the way out to Lake Success, Long Island to treat what I have. If I was to go to the urgent care center here, that's actually within here, they are not going to help me manage my medical care. I have to go outside in order to receive that upstage and it's something I don't understand, I just don't. And I'll say this just to be transparent, you don't see a lot of rheumatologists or pulmonologists within Jamaica, Queens. You're not going to see...", "4694": "And again, all my doctors are not color, I don't have a doctor of color at all, it would be refreshing for me to see. Like if I was in Atlanta, you will see someone of your color as a physician, all my physicians are white. So it's like, what do I do? Even my dentist, the ophthalmologists, everywhere I go to receive some type of care, it's I would have to go outside of my community to receive the best and on top of that, it's a white person. And that's one of the challenges I've always suffered. I even tried to search just to see but you don't see that. I don't know how it is in California, wherever, but I know in Atlanta, majority of the physicians like that are of color. But that's one of the peeves I have. I don't know if that makes sense but...", "4695": "Well, thank you very much. Monique, you have your hand raised.", "4696": "Yes. I want to add to that because I have to think about every time that I have decided that I was going to go see someone in mental health for myself, when I was really, really struggling, what haunted me every time with that, I did not see anyone of color. So I always felt like they don't know my struggle, they probably have never, ever gone through what I've gone through. And so for years, absolutely years, I have not seen anyone to this moment to be able to reach out to and speak to. And I think that it would help if we have more doctors, psychologists, and people of that nature of color in our communities, as well as in our kids' schools. So I just wanted to piggyback a little bit off of that and I agree.", "4697": "Okay, thank you. Rosemary. Oh, okay. Your Venice. You're on mute.", "4698": "I'll add my part to that and piggybacking on what Monique said particularly mental health. I think we started the conversation in that area of mental health, Rosemary said it. It's been a challenge trying to find someone in your community who can give you the quality of service that you need, who won't put you on the assembly line and take your copay and send you out the door in 50 minutes. And when you tell them what's wrong with you it refuted like, I'm smarter than you so I'm telling you what's wrong with you, pay me and leave. And that was a particular challenge with a family member just trying to get the care. I had to go out of my community, also out of network, use a substantial portion of my savings to get some help. And financially, I'm still trying to recover from that.", "4699": "So to what the woman said in that piece just now, it's absolutely real. Why should we have to travel or stay and get or not get the help we need or get mediocre help and not get the respect of hearing what I'm saying and believing me and trusting me that I know what's happening in my body or my household? So I can definitely attest to that challenge as well.", "4700": "Okay. Thank you, Venice. Rosemary.", "4701": "So something in the video that the young lady said really that means... When she said, whether we live, I'll use our example, whether I live in Bedford Park or whether I live in Park Avenue and I have the same insurance, why is it that I'll go to Park Avenue, I get a better treatment than what I do in Sheila Park? And I'm experiencing that presently. So why would I go to... We all have choices, right? So, and of course, when we have something going on, we go and always get second opinions to see what we're going to do. So why would I go somewhere uptown because I want a second opinion, they offer more of what is going to be done but then when I come down my wing, my community it's no we're not going to do this, we're just going to do what you need?", "4702": "So it makes you think, what is the difference? It's the same diagnosis, it's the same element, it's the same procedure, why is it that the treatment would be different? And then left me a little bit, not confused, okay, which way am I going to go? I'm comfortable here, but I feel safe over here. So they addressed it here and they addressed it over here, but why is that this one is going a step further and this one they don't? So it can be there is disparity between community. Which community you're going to go to seek help? If I seek in here, I'm going to get just the limit of what I'm going to get, but if I go here, they're going to give me a little bit more. So it is I always try to understand, okay, what is the difference and up to this day, I just don't get it. Why is it that the treatment has to be so different?", "4703": "Okay, thank you. Anyone else want to comment on the video? Anyone having anything to add, anything different?", "4704": "So I think we have to start at the level of medical school, right? And the level of getting more minority, underrepresented people into medicine, especially males. Because I think as a community and as a people, males, in general, in terms of their health tend to shy away, tend not to own up, and tend to evade issues around their health, whether it's their physical health or their mental health. And I think they would probably go and see their primary care physician or go and see any physician if that person literally looked similar looked like them, right? If they had the same color or speak the same language.", "4705": "So I think it starts from the level of recruitment and these [inaudible] whether it be dental, medical, pharmacy, wherever, we need to recruit more physicians, more dentists, more pharmacists of color in our schools. And I think it starts from that. So we have more physicians, we have more people of color and all these professional schools and that will lead to a community where every other block or every other neighborhood, we have someone that we can call and we have someone that we can go and see and feel comfortable with. And I believe that's where we need to start.", "4706": "Can I add something to that? Because I was part of CUNY and one of the things is we did do that when I was part of the camp, whether it was Medgar Evers College or LaGuardia, we would do that with some of the students. But it's about the follow-up and follow-through. We can definitely bring in people through the recruitment but one of the things is do you have the right people? If it's a guidance counselor or major wherever to actually carry that interested, for example, it's a black male that wants to be a doctor? He goes in and someone approaches him in the recruitment and then after that, it's flat-line. Who is actually following-up and following-through to walk that brother through to keep his interest going? And not only that, which counselor or which person is actually not going to divert? Because I've seen that happen.", "4707": "They'll see a young male, black male that wants to be a doctor and then he gets a certain amount of steps. But then if you have that certain counselor or faculty member that gets in his ear and says, you know what? You need to go this route because it's going to be too much school and you're going to just want to get the money to get paid, they get strategically diverted out. I'm telling you, it's just racism within, even in the... I've seen it happen. So you've got to have that right person of color to be there to guide him and also slap away the... And just say, no, you're going to be a doctor and you're going to keep coming to me and I will put you in contact with a certain network because that's how I did.", "4708": "I created my own network of people and if this person wanted to go into a certain career path, I made sure it was a person of color that was always in their ear. Persons of color that wield leadership and that also practice the path. And I made sure they carry them through. It's just creating that network of people of color because it just takes one or two persons of non-color to divert them and steer them away. And that's what it's called, strategic [inaudible] and getting them out because I've seen it happen so many times.", "4709": "Okay, Rosemary. Thank you, Simone. I have Rosemary with two hands up.", "4710": "So I was listening to what Venice was saying.", "4711": "Venice.", "4712": "Venice. Hi, Venice. So when you were talking about that we need encouragement, so this is why, and I have to say this is a platform and you gave me the opportunity, Mentoring Medicine. So these are for kids who also want to be doctors and PAs, and this is a group... Dr. Holden, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I just thought again the kids that were coming were interested in becoming doctors and they have a lot of programs for them. And one thing that when these kids get together and, of course, you have your parents saying you can't do it because you're spending too much money, you can do it, go work somewhere else. So there's a lot of don't do it, don't do it, don't do it because what other issues there can be problems at home. Once these kids get together in the program that I see in the Mentoring Medicine is they support one another.", "4713": "So you were talking about support, right? So in these groups, in these programs and I'm glad that Montefiore has this program for the minorities, for the ones who says you can't do it, you're never going to be a doctor. That there are PAs they're shadowing, they have role models that they can follow and say if you did it, I can do it. Enough female providers come from good backgrounds, there are providers who have come from being on Medicaid, being on welfare, [inaudible] you just have to work constantly. But you also need somebody saying you can't do it, that there are programs that will help pay for it. And I think getting the proper guidance, the correct information, student loans plays a big role in it. And I'm with you and I'm grateful that Dr. Holden has this program and it's at Montefiore.", "4714": "And then there was this one group of kids that I met, it was all nine of them, I can't leave none out, they all touched my life in a way that a group of kids have not been able. It was just an amazing experience, them allowing me into their lives, knowing about Mentoring Medicine. And they taught me what Mentoring Medicine was about, they told me what Dr. Holden is doing, they taught me on what they're giving to the students, to the other kids of color, of the minorities of what is it that they can do. Erica, Nikisha, there was a whole group. And I think Dr. Holden that has this program, keeps it running in Montefiore. And I just had to say that when she was saying about support and guiding them and telling them that they can do it. And I think Mentoring Medicine does play a big role in this and has [inaudible] our community and how we can spread the word along to other students. I just had to say that, it was banging in my heart when I heard them say that.", "4715": "Thank you, Rosemary, for that. Thank you very much. So we're going to move on to the next question. So here's a question for brief reflection, given our conversation today, what would a New York City, where everyone can be healthy look like and what would it feel like? I think we've touched upon that, but, if you could talk briefly about that maybe 30 seconds. Again, given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like, and what would it feel like?", "4716": "Any order?", "4717": "Oh, yeah. Well, the order, we should go back to that. Okay, Rosemary. Want to pass? Okay, Simone.", "4718": "Well, first and foremost, I will be remised to not say this to all the healthcare professionals that I am on this Zoom call with, Dr. Holden, any others that are working in... I appreciate you, I salute you, and I pray for you, and I thank you for sacrificing your lives every day just to save everyone that's going through this. You are all angels and I just want to thank you for everything that you are doing, just being part of the medical field and throughout this pandemic, you are all angels so thank you. I just wanted to say thank you for that.", "4719": "What I can say is that how we can make us better is again, like when I started the values, the empathy. Whether it's your personal or your professional life when you're in your, and I would say the professional life, your coworkers look at them as and I say your workplace family because when you're in this pandemic and you're watching this and you're side by side trying to make sure someone's on the ventilator and a life passes and then you all are holding each other, look at them as not just colleagues and coworkers, but just as fellow human beings and having the empathy. Because again, it's about... And if you oversee a staff, and I've been there, they're not just disposable talent. These are your people that keep you up and you feed off of each other. So just continue supporting each other and praying for each other.", "4720": "Even if you don't practice that faith but just go to a higher power, say uplift my coworker. So if they go home and they lose a patient today, I'm giving them some type of good spirit so we can make it in and do this again the next day. Because again, I had to learn the hard way, just being identified either as just someone that's just collecting a paycheck or just someone that I work with that's uplifting each other, just embracing and looking your coworkers and colleagues as not just that, this is your workplace sister, your workplace brother, your workplace mother, or father and this is where you build your strength just to save somebody else. So that's what I can give.", "4721": "Thank you, Simone. Caron. Again, the question is given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like and what would it feel like?", "4722": "All right. So what I envision for New York City moving forward is a city that embraces equality, a city that ensures that everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of race, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of socioeconomic status, regardless of sexual orientation, regardless of disability, regardless of everything. Just a New York that closes the gap of this disparity and assure that everyone can live a quality life. I also envision a New York that will promote healthy nutrition, a New York that will do away with these street deserts, and basically have places where people can go and buy and partake of nutritious food, vegetables, fruits as opposed to those sugary drinks that you find in the delis, those salty meats that you find in delis. So, a New York that has less of those and more fresh fruit and fresh vegetables.", "4723": "I also envision a New York that promotes exercise and health and have more parks, more trails for bike riding, more community centers, that encourages physical activity for youth, for everyone because blacks, Hispanics they're disproportionately overweight, obese which we all know can lead to all these high-risk factors that make us more susceptible to diseases such as COVID. So, in general, I just want a New York that's safe or neighborhoods that are safe, we have police that patrol, we have neighbors that look out for each other, and just a much safer and a much more high quality healthcare care for all.", "4724": "Great, thank you. So let's see who's next, Venice, what would your vision of a healthy New York look like? Or is there anything different that you have from Caron? I know you spoke a lot about your advocacy on your block. Was there anything different that you have or that you would envision a healthy New York to look like and feel like?", "4725": "I envision physical activity being more a part of us as opposed to something that you have to send your child to school and have gym once a week. Physical activity should be part of everything. In other communities you'll see whole families walking in the park, I don't see that much in our communities except young men playing ball in the local park or maybe little kids. So I believe an effort should be made in using the resources that we've traditionally used. Again, going back to the churches and the schools, that's a big part of our community. So you feed the spirit and you take care of the body as well, physical activity should be promoted there.", "4726": "So instead of having 10 little churches on one block, you have a place where children can go after school. If it means opening a school in the neighborhood for after school activities where kids can go work out until their mom comes home instead of coming home and sitting in front of the TV with a sugary snack. So grassroots at church, grassroots at school, instead of having half an hour of gym for the whole week, have physical education, schedule it at least twice a week. At least 45 minutes where that child knows that he or she, they have to pack their clothes for gym, you have gym today. And unless you have some kind of physical disability, you must go to gym.", "4727": "And healthy eating should be taught in the classroom. There should be, I don't know if they have it in public school, but there should be a health class where children who don't have the advantage of parents who cook well balanced meals at home they're taught. A lot of kids learn things at school that they bring home and teach home and educate home. And home improves because this child learned something at school and they're going to teach the family how to make a green smoothie. So that's a healthy New York to me, it starts young and it starts at the grassroots, in the places where we frequent or the places where we've always been, church and school. And I speak about my community, in particular, I'm not speaking for everyone obviously.", "4728": "Thank you for that. Anyone else want to add anything? No? Yes, Monique.", "4729": "Okay, so I'll try this. But mine's out real quick. So I would say that a healthy New York to me would be healthcare access for all. And piggybacking [inaudible] Venice said equality and access, laws and policies that extends to everyone, compassion, of course, putting youth first because we always see that the youth is taken care of and most times they're taken care of last, mental health, stronger community relationships. I also would love to see that our children are educated on school grounds for human trafficking, this is something that affects our youth every day, all day. They're peer to peer recruited on the school grounds, so it's important that we have prevention services within the school services now within school. So that's just one way that I see.", "4730": "Cheryl.", "4731": "Yes. So I would say as the greater conversation occurs these days about defunding, I want to put more funds into education and definitely about educating the public through how to recognize their health and be more proactive about their health. And whether that means through exercise, eating well, getting foods that are readily available, good healthy foods in our neighborhoods, in our supermarkets that are not always present. So I think education piece and funding is a big part of it. And certainly, I'd like to see a New York that we have healthcare access to good quality healthcare, no matter what your zip code is.", "4732": "Great, thank you. Listen, we had a robust conversation, I appreciate your time and your energy. Those are all the questions we have for you. Anyone have any closing thoughts that you'd like to share or general reflections about the conversation? I will just remind you that these recordings will be transcribed, indexed, and eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in the Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Department of Health so that they can inform Healthy Living 2024. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voices Network. And if you would like to convene another group of friends to participate or know of anyone else who would like to participate, you can go to the website, www.l as in Lynn, v as in Venice, and n as in Nancy .org. lvn.org.", "4733": "There is a brief survey if you would not mind just spending a couple of minutes doing the survey, which I believe Alex will put up on the screen. And for everyone, please make sure I have your mailing address. I did get some of them but if you could shoot me your mailing address, that would be very much appreciated for the gift card. Alex, I'll turn it back over to you and the survey.", "4734": "Great. Thank you all so much for participating. I've posted the survey link in the chatbox. So if you don't mind, before you leave the call, just click on the link and it'll just take you five minutes. This was an amazing conversation and I really appreciate everyone's participation. Have a wonderful weekend.", "4735": "Okay. Thanks, everyone. So again, in the chat, the survey link will be there, Alex, thank you so much again for the opportunity. And if you click on it, you will have the survey which will take five minutes to fill out. So everyone have a great day. I'll give you a few minutes for that.", "4736": "Perfect. All right, so welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network in Department of Health. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I'll begin recording at this time and just share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following this conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another, and third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will uplift the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policymakers, and members of the media.", "4737": "To this end we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our personal stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. We're doing this in order to help build connections and foster conversations that improve our understanding of one another. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to the growing collection of similar conversations. In addition to the Department of Health, we'll also be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants in the project, at Cortico's discretion, with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "4738": "As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations with communities in the media and improve our understanding of one another. As a public conversation, a portion of it may appear in a local newspaper or broadcast in a local radio station or appear in other forms of media, so please only share what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. So, if you understand this, and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\"", "4739": "I agree.", "4740": "I agree.", "4741": "I agree.", "4742": "I agree.", "4743": "Thank you. So to make sure everybody gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation, we have a few guidelines and they're, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, to share the time and allow others to finish speaking and take turns, stay curious if you are [inaudible] questions, pause if necessary, which is important to think and take time for reflection, listen generously and assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have impact, and when possible close all unnecessary programs, applications, silence your phone and remember to mute when you aren't speaking. So is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything that you'd like to add or change?", "4744": "No.", "4745": "Awesome. Well then I'll hand it over to your lovely host Lynne.", "4746": "Thank you. Again, thank you everyone for joining. I love the fact that we are all up so bright and early on a Saturday morning, so thanks again. And then Yule, I'll clue you into the video, okay? Perfect. For the ease of this virtual conversation, we are going to use a modified circle process where each person takes a turn. I'm going to post the order in which people will be invited to respond in the chat box. I'll help transition one person to the next and you can always pass or pass and ask for us to come back to you, so don't feel compelled to answer right away. Does anyone have any questions about this process? Okay, so our circle will be Vilma, Suzanne, Ketty, just because that's the way you came on, so that'll be pretty easy to remember.", "4747": "Okay, so, to begin, we want to do a quick round of introduction. Please share just your first name or if you don't want, a pseudonym, because remember we are being recorded. In addition to your first name, please share a bit of background info about who you are. For example, where you live and what you do, and also a value that's important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today. So again, a little bit of background information about who you are, like where you live and what you do, and a value that's important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today.", "4748": "So I'll start off. My name is Lynne Holden, Lynne. I was born and raised in Philadelphia but for 25 years, going on 25 years, I've been working at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. I'm a physician. I live in New Rochelle but I spend most of my time in the Bronx and a fair amount of time at church in Harlem at Abyssinian Baptist Church, of course before the pandemic. This conversation is important to me because in addition to being a physician, I started a nonprofit called Mentoring in Medicine and we're all about educating youth about the health industry and the biomedical industry and this education, increasing health literacy among our communities, is something that is very important to me and is why Mentoring in Medicine and I decided to participate in this activity, so that we could talk to community members and find out what perceived obstacles and gaps were and help with building a platform to educate our population. Vilma.", "4749": "Good morning, my name is Vilma. I am a native New Yorker and I am an anesthesiologist. I also work at Montefiore Medical Center and I have to say that my interests really are around making sure that I keep the door open. I do believe that the door to higher education was opened to me when I was a youngster and I always appreciated that and I wanted to make sure that once I have achieved my goals, and I am still achieving more goals, but I've achieved some of my goals, and I want to make sure that others get a chance to enjoy the experience and really help out other people in the community.", "4750": "Thank you. Suzanne.", "4751": "Hello again. Hi, I'm Suzanne and I live in central Harlem. I've been here for quite a few years. I'm a retired New York City teacher, middle school, and also retired children's choir director with the Abyssinian Baptist Church, so I have lots of experience with children from let's say 6th grade up through high school. I also am a mother, grandmother, and great grandmother, so young people are very important to me. Since I'm retired, I'm not working at anything, but I continue to hone my skills in music and reading. I belong to several groups, and my interest in being part of this group is, if I think about it, helping young people and nutrition. What young people are willing to eat. What they consider good to them and for them and how that impacts their ability to learn and to prosper and that whole [inaudible].", "4752": "Thank you. Thank you. Ketty.", "4753": "Hi, good morning, my name is Ketty. I was born in Brooklyn. I've been living in the Bronx for 35 years. I work in the Bronx, I also work at Montefiore Medical Center. Working at Montefiore has risen my passion for preventive medicine and health equity. I see a lot of that lacking in the Bronx especially, and I really would like to be able to see something done where we all, as we want, all have the ability to afford good health through insurance, so whatever means. I'm all for free clinics if they can exist. But most importantly, that we all have equity, health equity. Equity is very important to me and that's a value that's brought me to this.", "4754": "Great, thank you. Thank you everyone for sharing. Okay, the next thing we would like to do is to invite you to share a little bit about yourself. Since we'll be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing looks like and feels like to you. Again, what does health and wellbeing look like and feel like to you?", "4755": "Next, think of a time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of that factors that supported your health and wellness at that time? And how did you feel? So again, think of a time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of wellness and health. What can you remember about why you felt you were at your best? What were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at this time? And how did you feel? We will go around one at a time to share our stories. Please remember that this is being recorded, so we ask that you not disclose any sensitive personal health information or use the names of other people when telling your stories. So, I'll begin.", "4756": "I can say that I felt the healthiest in my life... You know, it's interesting, I felt the healthiest I think when, well, there are two times, but the most recent time is when this pandemic started and that's because I was reading a lot about how to boost my immune system and I was trying to follow every guideline. I was pretty much on a strict set schedule with exercise. My spiritual life was, is... well, has gotten very strong over the course of the pandemic, but it really picked up when this pandemic hit. I would say also that my diet was a lot better, I didn't have these pandemic quarantine pounds because I was really cognizant of what I was eating, what nutrition I was getting from what foods and what was helping to combat this new virus. I felt at that time, ironically, petrified because I knew I had to take care of patients and not quite sure about the virus, but I felt joy in the sense that I was on a strict schedule. I felt holistically well at that time. Okay, Vilma.", "4757": "Yes. I'm thinking back to a time when I was able to utilize my vacation time and my lecture time, when I go out to meetings, in a way where I was able to incorporate friendship with business. It's kind of weird to say it, but I had it where I literally would have one week off every two months and it was just so important because I had a chance to decompress. I had a chance to relax. And the thing is is that I incorporated my friends into it so therefore we wouldn't say, \"Okay, we're going to work out in our individual states,\" we all lived in different states, and then we would meet up during that one week time. And so it was like a nice routine where you knew that there was a purpose. You would internalize work hard then play hard.", "4758": "At that point we would go around to different festivals, the Caribbean festivals and we would just have so much fun and then we would be like, \"Okay, go back to work. Let's work really hard because we know there's going to be fulfillment later.\" And then when I was courting with my husband, it was kind of cool because he was really into half marathons. I didn't know that it was such a thing where you would literally go around to different parts of the country and be around all these healthy people who are just so inspiring and they do it as a unit. So you would see families together and you would see all age groups, so you would see the 80 year olds and the 8 year olds working out. It was just so cool. So I would have to say that was like the best of times and definitely I want to get back to it. That's what I've got to do, definitely have to get back to it.", "4759": "Great, thank you. Thank you very much. Suzanne.", "4760": "Okay, and I was just really thinking about this. I think that there's more than one period where I have felt at my optimal best and that's when I was working, when I was teaching. Actually I was teaching middle school classes and I was functioning as a literacy coach in my school and so that meant working with teachers. So, I got to interact with adults who were working with high school children and those who were working with middle school, and then what I was helping them to change, I would also implement in my own classes. So that was very stimulating for me.", "4761": "And I mean, that's emotional, mental, that's my drive, but at the same time being in a routine daily where you know what time you've got to start, you know the thing, you have to be prepared, what you're prepared for, how you're anticipating, and then you have to plan your downtime, knowing that in the evening you could come home and relax, try not to work too much at home. And my husband was really good in helping me to relax, just helped to provide that time. And I looked forward to those school vacations during the year, winter, spring break and all that. Then of course summer vacation which, it takes you like three weeks to come down from the mountain of teaching so that you could actually think about other things and your mind's not so crowded because you literally eat and sleep your job. You wake up in the middle of the night and you're thinking about what you need to do, what you shouldn't have done, what you're going to change, you go through all of these machinations.", "4762": "And then I retired and I can't tell you how happy I am. And your life gets filled. It gets filled with friends and activities that you didn't have time for before. So, transition from teaching children to [inaudible] choir, to singing in the choir, which is something I really didn't have time to do and wanted to do for many years. And then singing a little jazz on the side, so the world just opened up and then I joined the YMCA and I met more people and we got involved in water aerobics. Most of the people are retired including the instructor, seasoned gentleman, and so the class is very vigorous and we started referring to ourselves as reconstituted teenagers not senior citizens.", "4763": "And you develop this attitude and not just the exercise class in the water which is absolutely the best, especially for people with arthritis etc., but what to eat, how to eat, conversations with other trainers, and you feel so enthusiastic about life. And then, and I think Vilma mentioned it, older people, people who are older than I am, who are coming to the Y and they're exercising and they're going to theater and their quality of life, even though they have those physical limitations, is just so wonderful because instead of declining, you feel like you're really increasing, and so, I think now, although I miss the Y, the pandemic [inaudible], just put a block in the [inaudible], but now and when I was working, those are times when I really feel I was doing my best.", "4764": "Great, thank you. Thank you. Ketty.", "4765": "I've had many spurs of good moments in my life. My career, my life, as a parent and all that started very young and because of the growth to my life, we all have setbacks. We have things that are missing that keeps us going and these are the things that stop us from continuing being completely healthy. So to me, I'm at my best when I can say that I am emotionally well. When I feel physically well. When I feel socially well. And I can say when I was 28 years old, I was at my best because I was young, I was idealistic, but most importantly I had all my four needs, my spirituality, my emotional, my physical, and I had my income, and I had my gentleman and I had my children that I was rearing. Then of course, what happens is, to me, when we go through these changes and something is missing.", "4766": "Health is eating well, yes, to me and health is exercising, but I strongly feel that I have to be very happy. Happiness is health. And unfortunately life isn't always happy, right? And sometimes we have these difficult jobs we have to go to that we love with all our hearts, and we want to balance it. And we want to stay happy. But you're putting a face to something how you really don't feel inside. So you're not feeling well. So learning to break through that inner self and bursting out, I think, is when I'm actually feeling best and healthy.", "4767": "And just like everyone else, there are stages, and we have to empower ourselves. I've learned very young... and I'm a twin. I've always had that other person, but you know we mature, we married, we have grandchildren, we've studied apart, and I've learned to live with myself, which was a big achievement for an identical twin. But because of that as well, we still need people. We need our environment. I am not healthy if my environment isn't healthy. If I go in a situation where I know that I have to give so much of myself, and then you walk away, how do you replenish that?", "4768": "Right now, for instance, we're living in a pandemic that... I'm a single person. I'm home and I don't want to go near my family because you work in a hospital, so how do you... And I'm not the only story in the world that's going through this pandemic. Right now, our physiology, our physical self, our emotional self, our spiritual self, we're always testing that. To me, that is the biggest part of my health. If I can always keep that healthy, I feel that I can take and do as much as the Lord says you're going to be here. So that's why again I say, we have to have a healthy environment. Being able to contribute and also being able receive the help that others are willing to give us. If we don't have other people to help us then, we can't help ourselves by ourselves all the time. So our environment, I think. So if my environment isn't as I would like it to be, that could be very ill for me because I think that's one of the important things.", "4769": "When I turned 42 years old, prior to that I did have a health issue and I decided that I was going to take control of myself and my life, and I hit the gym, and I started reading more about... I knew that eating was one of our most important things, only because of our family history of other family members, but I took control of my life. I went from below zero to above 50 as far as my spirit, feeling my body again. I'm young, I'm 42, I'm at my best. I'm happy to say that I experienced that at that age.", "4770": "Currently, I was saying to myself, \"Okay Ketty,\" I've been going to school a lot so I've been living a bit of a sedentary life, so I said to myself, \"No you're going to go to the gym. This is it. This is your year,\" then I guess, pandemic had other plans for me. Although I can work out, but you walk outside, you have to wear the mask, it's necessary, so it's a little discouraging, but as long as I can keep my spirits and my emotional life healthy, I think that I could keep myself healthy and I can think better and I can go further and I can do more.", "4771": "Great, thank you. Thank you very much. So let's now move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your communities. Ketty talked a little bit about that. So for purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly and share about either your neighborhood community, or your social community. When you are responding to questions, if you are speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you are thinking of when you share your story. I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope that this will be a time for some back and forth among you as you share your stories. So this is the time that if you have something to add to what someone's saying, you can raise your hand and then I'll make sure to call on you.", "4772": "So I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has the opportunity to do so. So let's get started. What in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us to understand this a little better. So, again, what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and wellbeing? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand a little better. And I'll start off.", "4773": "So, around Montefiore in the area of the Bronx, when I first started there about 20 years ago, 24 years ago, there weren't that many places to get fresh fruits and vegetables. And so I've noticed within the last, I would say maybe five, six years or so, they've started to have these fresh fruit carts around. And one is there 24 hours. So even if you're doing an overnight shift, you can run outside and get a banana or whatever, grapes, and the food is actually pretty good and its reasonable. And so by having those carts there, that's really helped, not only myself, but others to increase the fresh fruits and vegetables that they're able to obtain in that \"food desert.\" We do have bodegas, but the bodegas often have sugary drinks and snacks and cold cuts, so they don't really have too many fresh fruits and vegetables.", "4774": "But it's also interesting that the one cart that I really love was a gentleman, could hardly understand what he was saying, but he was just so kind and he would always throw an extra orange or an extra banana and he made the fruit cart come alive, so to speak. So between the actual fruit cart being there and this great gentleman who actually added the tlc to the fruit cart, that I think really helped the community. I know for myself, but there was often a line there too, so I'm sure he was doing the same with others. So that's my story. Vilma, you want to take it away?", "4775": "I would have to say I've noticed it in my family. Before, I think we had a diet that wasn't quite what the American Heart Association wanted, but over time, it's really been a process where it's changing and evolving. At first, it started with my father who was known for making steaks on the barbecue in the summertime. And then all of a sudden he just switched his diet to fish. And everyone was like, \"Wow. What's wrong with dad?\" And then it was one of those things where people were saying, \"Hey, we're going to have a family dinner, let me bring something healthy to the dinner,\" and part of it is you want to make the traditional dishes, but then you want to incorporate and change it a little bit so that it's more healthy.", "4776": "So, it's like a family affair trying to get healthy because we noticed that the previous generations... They were like, \"Why do some people live a long time and other people just die super early?\" Then when we started looking at it and we're like, \"Wow, there is a trend here that's happening.\" And now, I have to say, my brother and I, what we do to encourage us in this pandemic where you can't go out to the gym, we call each other at night and we do a video conference and we watch a YouTube video and we do stomach crunches and ab exercises. And again, we both have busy lives, so it's like ten minutes. So it's not hard core forever and ever, but it's something. And it's encouraging. You say, \"Okay,\" and then you know what we do? Not only do we say, \"Okay, we did that.\" Then we say, \"What did you eat today?\"", "4777": "Because really, whenever you go to the gym and you go to the trainers, they're like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can come to a one or two hour training session throughout the week, but the real thing is, what are you eating throughout the week.\" So we try to encourage each other because we both are guilty in terms of snacking. My favorite snacks coming from work after a long a day was like, \"I deserve a strawberry shake and a french fry on my way home.\" And then I was like, \"You know what, I can change that. I can change that.\" So now what do I have in my car as I'm going over the bridge, I have nuts, and then I eat an apple. It's like a whole new mindset.", "4778": "And I'm like, \"You know what, I'm actually kind of full.\" And so it's changing. I don't want to say I'm doing a fad. I'm trying to do a lifestyle change. I like the fact that my community is doing it. My husband, eight years ago, he kind of tried to do it abruptly, too abruptly for me I think, because he wanted us to just totally get rid of all meat. And I was like, \"Listen, I can't do that. I like certain meats.\" But now I realize the importance of moderation. So I'm trying. It's a family affair, and that's what I'm doing.", "4779": "Nice, nice. Okay. Suzanne.", "4780": "There so much that resonates with me with what both you, Lynne, and Vilma have said about the food stands and the access to healthy food, especially snacking at odd times of the day and night and family members, particularly with parents. My father was a cook in a veterans hospital and he ran one of the kitchens and he talked a lot of diets and the different kinds of diets that they required and how you could make such things as your own mayonnaise, and how you could cut down fats by substituting one ingredient for another. So I grew up with this voice in my head talking about health. And then of course early 20s and 30s and [inaudible], you kind of get away from some of that. I always ate and served balanced meals for my family because I grew up with that, and that was really important. Both my parents were very health conscious. And so I found that in my earlier years I could eat more. Maybe I was burning more calories because you're younger, you're moving around a lot more, and so I ate more meat. The portion sizes were larger.", "4781": "As I get started to get older I notice that I didn't need to eat quite as much so I started cutting fat. Snacking and working that was kind of a problem because by the end of the school day somebody would have cookies in their desk drawer or you might want some ice cream on the weekend and things like that. Our church had the kitchen open, there was always the dessert [inaudible] and my husband loves to bake. He would bring it on and I would eat it and he had more will power than I did. Then you would [inaudible] a broad picture. And you realize that you're not running around as much, going to the gym let's say. But then the doctor's telling me, \"Okay, you need to slim back here, increase exercise over there.\" And you start to make these adjustments because your friends now, your contemporaries are all having to do the same thing.", "4782": "So I'm grateful that I live in a community, an area of the community where there are fruit stands out on both sides of the street. There's a supermarket a block or so from me and while I wouldn't buy everything in that store, their fruits are really pretty good and the prices are okay. And fortunately, there's a Whole Foods that I can walk to, and you pick and choose what it is that you want, but they have this wide variety of vegetables, and it's unlimited, string beans, cabbage, collard greens, three or four things that the community might consider great to eat, you want to look outside of that and when you have experiences outside of your own community.", "4783": "When I was working for the college where I went to graduate school, I found out about these grape leaves that [inaudible] and different kinds of vegetables and fruits and cheeses, so the wider I think your repertoire is, then you can make more choice about good foods for you to eat and you learn how to eliminate fast food varieties and so... Now if I were to bring a cart with my friends, since we're all in the same age group, we share a lot of recipes of, \"What are you having for dinner? How are you going to fix that? What are you going to have with that?\" Sometimes we send each other pictures on our phones.", "4784": "One of my children, her and her family have become vegetarians for health reasons and so she will pick up a dish and [inaudible] and this and that, things that you wouldn't typically think of putting together, and she'll send me a picture of it. And tell me how good it was and how filling it was, which is really important because if you're not full, you're going to get hungry and you're going to reach for something that you shouldn't.", "4785": "One particular story, and this is with a friend of mine, who introduced me to these ice pops which are sugar free, can't mention the name, but they're very good and the fruit flavors really come through. And there's this [inaudible] it's apricot, if you really like apricots, and so I found them on my online food delivery service and I was excited because, \"Yay I learned how to get this.\" [crosstalk] fish and more fish and stuff because less meat and increasing the vegetables and cutting back on the carbs. Dessert once in a while [inaudible]. We really are moderating what we eat. Thank you.", "4786": "Great, thank you for sharing that. Thank you for sharing. Suzanne, you spoke earlier about the Y and your involvement with the Y and swimming. Can you talk a bit about that and how that contributes to your community?", "4787": "Sure. Of course the Y services all ages from babies, and you will see mothers bring their babies in for swimming lessons and then they have the day camp, they have some school groups come in and will use the gym facilities, which is really good because not all the schools, especially the one I retired from had all the gym facilities that some with a larger campus might have.", "4788": "As far as the exercise classes, there is such a variety. If you want salsa dancing, if you want spin, if you want to use the weights, if you want to work with a trainer, all these things are available. And then the aquatics program is wonderful. They have times during the day into the evening where people who are real swimmers can go and do laps and then there are lots of water aerobics classes, you've got two, three, four, every day. Early in the morning, mid-morning, in the evening. And so you get people who will come in before they go to work, people coming right after work, and then those who are, like myself, who are retired, can come and spend hours almost every day if you wanted to spend the time that way.", "4789": "You come in, you have your lockers, really nice facilities too, where you feel comfortable using them, the building is well kept, and so you take your shower, you get into the pool and the pool temperature is kept at a level where those of us who are a little more seasoned than others, don't feel like we're going to freeze when we get in the water. And so the instructor keeps us moving and cheering us all the time, yelling at us, and he plays this R&B music, so sometimes we'll find ourselves singing or we may get so used to the routine that after a while we say, \"Okay, we know what exercise is coming up based on the song.\" But it provides so much fun and his class has got so popular that if you didn't get there like an hour and a half before the class started, you couldn't get in. They have to limit the number of people they will allow in the pool because the size.", "4790": "But this makes everything so enjoyable and then they're video Staying In Touch on Facebook, that you just talk about the Y. This is happening at the Y. There are dance classes, and even, I'm trying to think what it is, where you're doing these... Tai Chi, in the pool, so like dancing style in the pool. I tell you there's [crosstalk] dance. And some people have a little difficulty with the rate, but there's help for that. There's insurance coverage and it's just so enjoyable you look forward to going there. I'm sorry, there's somebody at my front door and it's right here, and I don't see who this is. I'm sorry, excuse me. Maybe somebody else can continue.", "4791": "Keep the video on. Ketty yes.", "4792": "Well I'm really excited. As you know, I live and work at Norwood section of the Bronx, which is literally down the block from my job, where I live. So about four years ago it was very discouraging for me. I couldn't find a decent fruit market. I couldn't find fish. I literally had to travel over to Co-op City so that I can get my groceries, decent groceries. And the only thing we have are this one farmers markets cart down by [inaudible]. I would literally have to walk all the way down there to get discount fruits and vegetables. That was very concerning to me. These are the concerns that I shared with my local government. We need more fruits. We need to be healthy. I kept writing little letters and what not. In the meantime, I did realize that there were two gyms that opened up. One was Crunch on Webster and then we had one they were constructing was Blink. So I went in there and I said to them... went to inquire on the prices. Found out that if you're a Montefiore employee, you get a 25% discount. I literally joined for $16.00.", "4793": "The gym gives you these free classes, everything. I'm saying to myself, \"Okay, well this great. This is a great start.\" The section of the Bronx where I live unfortunately there is a lot of poverty. The health disparity in health equity is enormous. So I knew that we needed better. We needed to be able to afford good food and not continuously eat... There were just fried food places, nowhere you could get a salad. So little by little because I think, Montefiore, in the building we had a little store across the street where you could get yourself a salad, but who can afford a $8.00 salad every day. So I'm like, \"No, we need vegetables that we can buy. Not just myself but my neighbors, that live on a real fixed income, that they can toss and eat and be healthy.\"", "4794": "Well, about the last three years, little buds, these vegetable places started opening. The man in front outside, that was just like the tip. If you walk down Jerome Avenue, you have about five food and vegetable markets that are being distributed by the farmer's market. So because these fruits and vegetables are coming from the farmer's market, the prices cannot be... It has to be at an economical level where you're going to price them. So you can literally get five apples for $2.00. So I'm looking at this and I'm saying to myself, and I'm seeing the neighborhood, everyone just with their shopping cart and they're buying all these fruits and vegetables, and I'm excited. I'm saying to myself, \"We've arrived. Norwood had arrived. I'm going to be healthy. My neighbor's going to be healthy.\"", "4795": "About a year later I'm looking up, I say, \"A fish market? They're opening up a fish market?\" Well, yes. Not only is this fish market somewhere where you can go if you're working and you can get something steamed and eat it for lunch, you go to the back and they've got all this fresh fish that you can buy. And then before you know it, they opened up another fish market. So believe it or not, Norwood, it has transformed. I'm very excited. Sometimes you get discouraged and you say, \"Do I continue living here?\" I mean, so convenient for me to go to work, but is it healthy for me? Because my health, I have to have it in my environment. My environment is important.", "4796": "But I can tell you that I'm excited. I'm excited about Norwood and we're able to afford, if you work in the community, and even senior citizens. They're giving you different discounts at the gym. You can afford to go to the gym. You can afford the fresh vegetables and fruits and if you want to snack on something, it doesn't have to be fried chicken and french fries. You can literally get something steamed and take it home and eat it, or take it to work and eat it.", "4797": "So, I'm actually very excited about my neighborhood and so I'm very happy. As you can see, it literally brings tears to my eyes because for the past five, six years, it was horrible living in Norwood and wondering, \"Am I going to survive this? Am I going to survive?\" How could anyone flourish within their own community and their environment and how could they break that cycle if they're not given an opportunity to feel better, do better. To be able to have the same quality of health. So, yeah, I have to say that I'm... At home I've always learned to eat better and I have my own personal thing about it, but as far as my environment, my community, there's a lot of good stuff going on.", "4798": "Nice. Vilma, did you say where you... What do you consider your community? I think I missed that.", "4799": "Oh, okay. My community starts, to me, with the family and then it goes to my neighbors.", "4800": "Oh, no, I mean your location. I know you work at Montefiore, the location.", "4801": "Oh, I'm sorry. Where do I live? Oh yes, I live in Nassau County.", "4802": "Ah, okay, got it. Got it. All right. Excellent, excellent. Well, now, let's talk about the pandemic. What are you learning about your communities wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like for others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us to understand this a little better. So again, what are you learning about your communities wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us to understand this a little better. So we'll start with you Vilma.", "4803": "Well as a physician, you know I'm interested in medicine and I appreciate all the advances that are there in medicine but I also realize the limitations, and it really wasn't until this pandemic that I truly began to appreciate traditional medicine, because I realized that sometimes the doctors don't know all the answers and in order to get better, sometimes going back to basics is so important. So I've learned a lot about which antibiotic to take in order to get better, but also just knowing that sometimes just a good cup of soup does wonders and taking time to listen to your body and rest does wonders. I've learned to balance the two really well.", "4804": "I remember this great recipe when I was a child, my aunts used to get a pot of water and put onion and garlic and lemon and a little bit of honey and say, \"Drink this, you're going to feel better,\" and I was like, \"Oh, come on, we got antibiotics, we don't need all that stuff, what are you talking about.\" Boy of boy I had that pot boiling when I was sick with the COVID. I said, \"Boy, this thing, it really does work.\" So, I like to listen to my elders. I really began to appreciate listening to your elders and getting their assistance when times are tough and knowing the importance of the strength in family and friends. I had such a wonderful core group of people who were calling, who were like, \"You know what, are you okay? Are you okay?\"", "4805": "There was something at one point, the CDC always kept changing the rules and at one point they were saying, \"Okay, when you have a cough just stay at home and stay by yourself,\" but when it happened to my brother I was on the phone and I was telling his children, I said, \"Don't leave him in a room by himself because he's quarantining himself, because guess what, you have to make sure he's breathing okay,\" because when I called him he was like so short of breath and I was like, \"Oh my gosh.\"", "4806": "It's that critical period of time when you're like, \"When are you sick enough,\" and I realized unless you have a pulse oximeter in your house to measure how much oxygen is in your body, someone has to look at you and say, \"You're sick. Go to the hospital. You have to bump this up. You just can't stay at home by yourself hoping to get better,\" because unfortunately with certain diseases, you really may not and you may die in your own house because you're trying to follow the rules and just take care of yourself by yourself and think, \"Oh, I can handle it.\"", "4807": "No, so you have to have that balance of traditional medicine and Western medicine. But also I think the key thing is making sure someone is there to take care of you. You have to have that family structure or friends around you to help you out because we talk about this being the year of the nurses, because really what a nurse is is someone who's looking out for you. Who's checking up on you and saying, \"Are you okay? Are you still breathing?\" Essentially that's what your loved ones at home are doing for you and family members, I mean, friends who call you and family members who call you. I definitely think this is a great experience, this whole pandemic, and people realize it is important to look at all the dials and the numbers and stats, but also just that tlc, that's going to get you through a lot, because they're going to make sure that you're not tipping over and that you may need special help.", "4808": "Yeah. Thank you very much for that. Suzanne.", "4809": "Okay. This pandemic has made us all feel like we're living in a bad movie or we're watching some program that we can't turn off because it just keeps coming back on. But on the positive side, one thing is a sense of humor because you have to make some joke sometime, you have to keep laughing as much as you can. A lot of what's on the news, and we're following Dr. Fauci and other medical experts and the New York doctor, so you're getting as much information as you can. And well, that's the larger community because it includes the whole country, the whole world.", "4810": "Specifically here where I live I notice that, I would say, 90% of the people that I pass on the street are wearing masks. People don't want to walk close to each other, although now you see things loosening up a little bit but most people are very conscientious about what they're doing. Going to the supermarket, is there a line? Oh, no there's no line. Okay wonderful I have to go in, but then you walk and you see, \"Okay, how many people are in the aisle? Are the workers there?\" So there's this awareness that's really important and New York has done an incredible job through all these medical professionals like yourselves, who sacrifice so much and give so much and that's why we can say that we are in the place that we are now.", "4811": "Like Vilma was saying, your family, your friends, those people who you check on, and they check on you to make sure that you're all right, especially if you are living alone. Excuse me. And to talk about what's happening to you on a daily basis. For example I had post nasal drip, pollen in the air, the humidity, fans, air conditioning, all that affects how I feel and a lot of people. So you're always evaluating, \"Okay, I know what's causing this, I'm not getting sick,\" but we watch and we pay attention. Some of us are taking our temperatures every day and sharing information. I think that sharing is the most important thing.", "4812": "A friend of ours, there's a group of friends that I've especially been close with, and we lost one of our group back in March. It wasn't because of COVID, it was other causes. And so we've gotten closer in terms of keeping up with what's happening with each other and especially one of our friends, he was the best friend for this person for many many years. So, not just are you staying in? Are people coming to your house? Are you going out to get some exercise? But, how are you feeling? Are you feeling sad? What can we do to cheer you up? Because that's all part of the [inaudible].", "4813": "A lot of people have lost family members and some people from our church family have passed away and it's shocking. I have a relative who's in a rehabilitation facility and has been there for some time and his family can't go visit him and he can't come home yet. And that's very hard, especially when people don't really understand why they're being quarantined the way they are. And relatives in nursing homes, they don't understand really what's going on. So, how do you support them? Just by being there. Just hearing a human voice. Letting people know that you're thinking about them means a whole lot.", "4814": "Thank you very much for that. Ketty.", "4815": "Well I can say I have three different types of communities that I live with and through COVID. I want to begin with my work community. We really supported each other during this difficult time. We were able to help each other innovatively so that we can learn more about this disease and to teach more about this disease. So that was my primary community because I was doing it 12 hours a day every day, going in on Saturdays.", "4816": "But then there was my family, my biological, my nuclear family. We were all on Zoom and I was able to share my things with them. Some of them were taking this serious, some, I would see them on social media getting together, no mask, and it was frustrating. I'm telling you what I'm seeing, what we're going through, and so that was a little frustrating. It changed my perspective a little bit because you have to say to yourself... You can't continue to, not necessarily respect, but to continue a cycle with someone that doesn't understand we're in a pandemic. I can't continuously share something with you and you're not really the respect and the empathy of what I'm telling you is not resonating, so it's a little [inaudible].", "4817": "But my community, my neighborhood, it was very important for me to see people wearing their mask. If they didn't, I would tell them, \"We're in a pandemic. You really need a mask.\" They spoke a lot about what they heard the President say and people in general on the TV that didn't wear masks or were very confused. \"Why is this person not wearing a mask? Why should we wear a mask?\" And I always kept telling them, \"I think that the medical community is the expert at this, so you may want to listen to what they have to say.\"", "4818": "Now my neighbors, I have five neighbors on my floor who are very close, and we're always knocking on each other's door, giving each other a dish that we made. And my floor was very quiet. And I would come home from work and I just wanted to make sure that I changed my clothes, threw my scrubs on the floor, go to the bath, and I would say within the fourth week of the pandemic, I knocked on the door of my next door neighbor and her son came out. And he told me that the family had COVID, that they were all sick, and was like, \"Wow,\" and I felt kind of bad, but at the same token, we don't know much about this disease. You knew not to knock on people's doors and try to stay away from them or you feel that you were going to be compromising their home, especially my really elderly neighbor.", "4819": "Normally what we did was we would knock on her door but leave her the food, because we always feed her, so we had to make sure that we gave her her meal but we couldn't give her contact. It's got to be lonely. We would call her but then we would leave the food hanging on her doorknob so she can come and get the bag out. So we've learned to be resilient as far as still communicating through different formats. We would knock on each other's door, just stay really far back. \"I just want to make sure that you're okay.\" I noticed that one of them, they were outside, they didn't have a mask, I said, \"Do you need a mask,\" because my sister, she ordered some and she'd send me some, so I gave them all to my neighbors. I said, \"You have to wear this mask.\"", "4820": "So the education about the mask, that was very important for me. It's still very important for me and my community. I am very grateful that we have now bills that say you can't go in a store without a mask. So these things are protecting us for sure but I would like to see it in the laundromat. I would like to see that imposed on different venues that people feel that they can walk around without wearing it. My resilience was to be able to communicate with my neighbors, to keep my communication going. Zoom, thank God. We were resilient. We learned. COVID was a bad thing that happened to us, but COVID also opened new avenues for us and what can we not survive and how will we survive it. How will we communicate with one another? So, yeah, keeping my neighbors, keeping in touch with my family, educating ourselves, and laughing through it, crying through it, that was my experience with COVID in my community.", "4821": "Great thanks for the input. Now I would like to bring in the voice of someone who participated in a conversation in the Local Voices Network recently. I want you to imagine that this person is in the room with us, or on Zoom with us, and listen closely to their comments. I'll then invite you to share any responses and insights you've gained from listening to their comments. So Yule, I guess you can start the video.", "4822": "The first things that come to mind just for the sake of time is a systemic change in the way that we do things from a top down level. From the big guys up there that make the decisions, to the ones that employ the services. There's no question that there is social, economic, and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels and that it affects our health. And if we can do away with that where everyone gets the same quality help, whether it's accessibility to food, and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals, across the board, that if I'm walking down Corona, my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan. There's going to be no change. Same quality of care there. That's the first thing that pops to my head.", "4823": "I was going to say...", "4824": "Okay. All right. It wasn't so much what you were reading, but what you heard. So, Vilma do you want to react? Vilma?", "4825": "Yes, hi.", "4826": "Hello. You want to comment on what the young lady was saying?", "4827": "Oh I think she's 100% right. I think this really brings out a lot of healthcare disparities. Of course my first thing I think of is how could we make it better from the provider standpoint. People do better when they see diversity amongst the providers who take care of them, so it's nice to see someone who is black or brown if you live in a black or brown community. But in addition, I think it's so key that it goes beyond who is taking care of you, but what resources do they have available? Do they have the equipment that is needed? I'm always curious in terms of the master plan, are they distributing the equipment equally throughout the nation?", "4828": "That whole thing with the protective equipment, it's like, \"Wow.\" From the providers' standpoint, it just seemed like they had no clue about it and even now, I had a conversation with a community in Brooklyn where they were trying to get masks distributed to the people in the neighborhood. Meanwhile, you know if you go to the upper east side, everyone has a mask, but there's something where there's a distrust in the community, where they don't necessarily always believe what the healthcare providers are telling them because there's been such a history of... you know that term medical apartheid, where the medical community has taken advantage of black and brown people so we never know. \"Okay, are they asking us to take this medicine because they want to experiment on us, or what's the ulterior motive?\"", "4829": "So here it is, we have something as simple as a face mask and are people in our community not wearing it because they distrust the healthcare professionals or they don't have access to it because they're not being distributed to them. It's frustrating. It's something that is still institutionalized that if there really is something where people are saying, \"Oh you know,\" the politician's like, \"Oh, that community, they'll be okay, they can buy their own,\" but they can't buy their own because there are no jobs in the neighborhood so they can't have enough excess income so that they can spend extra money on something like a mask, or getting healthy foods and things like that.", "4830": "So it's such a big issue in terms of the social determinants of health and this pandemic is bringing it to forefront, but we have to really start with concrete ways of alleviating it. So, I mean, through the diversity of professionals who are taking care of you. But, in addition, give the proper resources. And that proper resources starts, I think, at public education, at that level, where you have the resources where the kids are learning and that they're able to go to school and know that their job isn't just to get through high school, no, their job is to get through college, okay, because that's the way the world is nowadays.", "4831": "Some people debate me, say, \"You can't do anything with just a college degree, you need a master's degree too,\" so it's like, but we have to give them that foundation early and the foundation comes because people give those schools the resources and who gives those schools the resources is the politicians, so you have to work with politicians, and that means you have to vote. So it's like a cycle, and it's like, \"Ah, where do we start?\" But I think we have to be concrete and start somewhere. Start with voting, getting involved, make politicians accountable, saying, \"Hey, you're here to be a public servant, so you have to work with us so that we can all grow together.\"", "4832": "And in terms of education, I'm all for, even though we have a pandemic now, make sure those kids get that proper home schooling now, that Zoom, so therefore they can graduate, because no matter what, they have to graduate and they have to go to the next level and next level and next level, so therefore, they can bring it home to their own community and bring everyone up. It's a very complex issue, but I think we can really start working on it because we have so many people in our community who could take a piece of it. Not everyone can do everything, but I think if we all work together and we say, \"Hey, you got this, I got this,\" and we could all make it happen. But we've got to start. We just can't complain and go back to watching TV, same old same old.", "4833": "Thank you for that insight. Thank you for that insight. Suzanne.", "4834": "Hi. I agree that education is the foundation. It provides the insight, the awareness, and hopefully the desire to do better, to learn more, to protect yourself, to protect your family, to take this pandemic seriously. I think particularly in the community where I live, and in other black and brown communities, one of the problems, well, first we had to stop having in-class school and go to working at home on computers and other instruments. I think if the children had been able to be in a school building, that more would have been said about the pandemic. There would be some lessons depending on the children's ages, about what it means, why do we need to wear a mask, and other ways we take care of ourselves, the hand washing, and so on. My daughter teaches kindergarten and at five years old, some of them have just turned five, some of them are just out of wearing a Pamper or don't know how to wipe their [inaudible]. It's basic things that they're not aware of because they didn't get training at home.", "4835": "So if you think about who people listen to. Who are the parents listening to? Who are the children, the little ones listen to the parents, but as they get older and they become more independent, the middle school, high school years and so on, they're listening to voices in the media. They're listening to their artists and their comedians and actors and sports figures and so it's not enough for the parents to be educated. It's not enough for them to learn about it in school. Because like you were saying, Vilma, some people don't believe that there is a pandemic. I've heard on more than one occasion a friend or relative talking about some report they read from a reliable source on the internet, someone who's part of the government, they're part of the military and they know what's going on. So you hear these conspiracy theories about the government trying to get rid of us, saying they don't trust the medical community, they'd rather listen to their friends and so on, and that's a big problem.", "4836": "I think as people gradually see how we progressed in New York, they can relax with the conspiracy theory and see what is working, and hopefully that will guide their behavior. What I think really needs to happen, it's not just one person's job, the school can't do it alone, because children leave the school and go home to parents. They come back the next day. They're influenced by what's happened at home and that influences what they take in, willing and able to take in in school. I really think that more public figures in the [inaudible] government, I don't even mean the medical community. I really think that those people who have influence, the athletes, the musicians, the rap artists, the actors, these people who are held up as heroes by the community.", "4837": "Where I live, and I live in a house so I'm right on the street, I can hear all the noises from outside. I can hear people's conversation sometimes. These vehicles will race through the block and they're blasting rap music or something else, but they're like closed messages because they're not educating anyone about anything important. It's just entertainment. It's making people feel good. So the people that you're listening to need to be speaking up and telling you, \"Wear a mask,\" need to echo what the medical community is saying about what this virus really is. What's happening, not just on your block, because a lot of people only understand what's happening on their block. They either don't trust or they're not exposed to what's happening in the larger city. What's happening outside the five boroughs? What's happening across the country? In the world? Your world is not just your block or your immediate neighborhood.", "4838": "So a lot of the entertainers and the sports figures, they have a wider reach. They're exposed to people outside of their community, in the country and around the world, so speak to that. Let young people and not so young people know how serious this is and how we've all got to work together. I think that influence will make a great deal.", "4839": "Yeah. Thank you. That's great insight Suzanne. That's great insight. Thank you very much. Ketty.", "4840": "Well she spoke a lot of what I'm passionate about, the equity. We're at 2020 and why should a Park Avenue facility have better equipment than my Norwood doctor? Why can I not have the same kind of medical advantages as far as medication for any, could be for my chronic disease, terminal disease. Why do I have to travel so far to find a good doctor when we should be able... We're humans, right? But this is the revolution that we're going through. How long is it going to take for all of us to have the equity that we deserve? We all put into society our best and so many of us. You'd be surprised how many of us are all in the same shoe, same fit, but yet we're not getting the equity when it comes to the proper establishments, as far as medical establishment. People have to travel from one state to another to find a good doctor that's going to give the medicine, that's going to cure that child's illness. If that medication is there, that medication can be here.", "4841": "So, again, right now we're living a revolution and when it comes to medicine, food, equality, all that, we've been fighting this for way too long. We've been wanting this for way too long. Why? I just don't understand. That is the question. Why is it that we cannot have the same advantages that a community in Park Avenue has? I mean I wish I had an answer to that question. It's simple. It's there. The equipment is there. It is a company that builds equipment, that creates equipment, that sells it. If you can sell it to 650 Park Avenue, why can he not sell it to 220 Gun Hill Road? I really don't have an answer to that. But that is the perfect world. And no, everything isn't perfect, but when it comes to health, when will we all have the fair shake as far as health opportunities? Food opportunities. Educational opportunities.", "4842": "So equity is a thing we've been fighting and experts, experts have not been able to fix that disparity. Something has to give. What's it going to take? I wish I could tell you. I don't know, but I know that I'm trying so hard to be a part of the fixture, as far as that. Yeah, things start at home but unfortunately, a lot of homes are not happy. A lot of homes are broken, and unfortunately, a cycle continues. Yeah, we know that. And unfortunately it happens mostly in the poor community. It happens mostly in the community that can't afford things that can fix it. But as a society, as a society, as a adult, as a professional, we're responsible too. And this is a reason why too we come into this field. You don't go into a field of medicine or to a field of social work or to a field that deals with people. When your clients... When your revenue, because let's call it, that's also your revenue, are people, you have to find a formula that's going to best serve the people. It's not a formula that's going to best serve your self-interest.", "4843": "So I don't think that people are understanding this. I'm hoping that they are. Again, as we say, we hear a lot on the news, we see what's going on. It's not brain surgery to figure out what's to be done, what is it that needs to stop, what is it that we have to do. The answer's there, but it's ignored. When are we going to stop ignoring the needs? Because people, we have needs. In order for us to erase the disparity, or at least to close that loop, we have to admit and say, \"Yeah, you know what, I messed up. We're not doing this right. We need to fix it,\" and the proof is in the pudding. You can say you're sorry or you can say, \"We're going to try to get this community established with a better healthcare facility,\" no, you've got to do it.", "4844": "I've had family members that literally very ill, had to travel to another state to find a doctor. And of course, yeah, there is... I have to say you have some people who are the best in their field, but I'm quite sure they learned and they taught other people. And I'm sure that, again, the tools, the accessibility, medical accessibility, food, all that, we should be able to find it in our own community. Unfortunately I think this is why have health insurances, this is why we have rules of bargaining as far as when you sell groceries or when you sell a product, and that's understandable, but at least offer it. You're not even giving the community the opportunity to taste what it... \"Well, I'm giving it to you,\" you may want to have to haggle, you have to start somewhere, I get that. But at least offer it.", "4845": "And we need, we need our establishments, our medical, our groceries, our people of capability who are there to help the community, offer your services, because if you don't offer it, they're not going to know it's there. You've got to start somewhere. And that's how I feel. I'm very passionate. I love what this young lady had to say. She hit the nail on the head as far as what we should look like as a community. My community should look that way. Unfortunately it's a capitalist society we live in and I get it, we've got to haggle, it happens, but at least offer it. And that's what I would love to see. [crosstalk] Thank you.", "4846": "So you did a two in one Ketty. So you actually answered the next question, which is, given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like, and what would it feel like? So again, given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like, and what would it feel like? So we'll start with Vilma. Like I said, Ketty, you gave us a two in one, because you gave us the broad stroke picture of your ideal New York City. Vilma.", "4847": "Well, I think that a healthy city would be one where you have people are educated. People who are employed. People who have access to healthcare, okay? Healthcare has to be affordable. You have to have a system where people are in an environment that's clean, okay, and safe, that includes noise pollution, air pollution, has to be reasonable because those things are outside of their control. That's big business. They have to be able in the summertime to have the option of relaxing at the beach and not have to be swimming next to garbage bags, okay? Or needles in the sand or anything like that, okay?", "4848": "Those are some of the things that I think would help. I mentioned healthy foods, be able to de-stress, and that means after working, after having a job and being at work, you have to be able to have time for yourself and time for your family, so you have to have a happy family relationship where if there's anything that happens to them or any special events, the job should be so flexible that they completely understand that if you have a special event that you say, \"I have to go to this PTA meeting or this baseball game,\" they will understand that that is helpful in terms of the psyche of your child and your own psyche, and it helps with work productivity.", "4849": "I definitely think that balance is important so I think that it's the mind, body, and soul and people should be allowed to spiritually have a means of expressing themselves by whatever faith that they choose to follow. So I definitely think those are the components of a healthy city and healthy people.", "4850": "Thanks Vilma, that's great. Suzanne.", "4851": "Okay. Here we go. A healthy New York, one of the basic things of course is access to quality medical care across the city and the state. We have municipal hospitals, I live very close to one, and they have their problems, but like you said Ketty, to have the resources, the equipment, equally distributed for all medical facilities and not just based on maybe who can afford it, you know what I mean, so that we don't have some institutions that get bogged down in bureaucracies, competition from different contractors, and so they may not... Okay, the people who build machine ed which will go to the more affluent neighborhoods, may not compete with the contractors who are vying for a contract with the municipal hospital, so it's that they're playing in different arenas these business people because they go where the money is. That whole piece needs to be dismantled so that it is equitable. It shouldn't be a matter of, \"Well, if I go to municipal hospital a, I'm a businessperson, they're not going to be able to give me the money that want for my new equipment so I'm not even going to go there.\" That piece needs to change.", "4852": "In addition, in a healthy New York, insurance companies would not rule what medical services people can get, and the prices wouldn't vary so much. You can even have, in the same city, the same insurance company, but they'll have these subdivisions, so you'll talk to your friends and your friend will say, \"Well I get silver sneakers,\" well I have the same insurance company, so how come I don't get silver sneakers, you know what I mean?", "4853": "Or certain procedures that are covered by one insurance company but not another. You read the reports from the insurance company and you see that your doctor sent in a claim for a certain treatment, and the treatment is important, it could be critical to your wellbeing, but the insurance company will deny it. Why? Who knows, they don't consider it essential or they will only pay a portion of what the doctor is asking them for. So doctors, some of them, will inflate the charge to get closer to what they really need, so that they can stay in business as well. So the insurance company, that whole piece, they need to be more regulated.", "4854": "The education of the public problem, birth on up like I was saying, influence from the popular figures that people listen to. There's so much entertainment that it kind of keeps people blinded to some of the real issues that are going on, certain things that people do and they don't think about it at all, eat a hamburger, eat a something, bag of potato chips, just throw the litter in the street. I've seen masks that people have discarded, throw it in the street, they don't care about what happens to it. They don't realize or don't care if it's affecting their health. In a healthy New York, you wouldn't see that. You would see a cleaner city because people don't want the germs and the disease from the trash that they throw away. You would see less incidents of rats and insects, generally would be cleaner, more sanitized.", "4855": "And I think finally, in a healthy New York there would be fewer fast food restaurants. You know, your fried chicken, all the comfort foods that pop up especially in black and brown communities. You go downtown you don't see them. There would be fewer of them and perhaps healthier substitutes that could be made more popular across the city, across the state, so that if you go into neighborhood g, let's say, just using the alphabet, you'll find the same healthy food there that you'd find in neighborhood r. You don't have this, \"Okay, well I feel like some fried chicken today, I'm just going to go around the corner and get blah blah blah's fried chicken.\" No, maybe you'd go to another restaurant which has a healthier roasted something, air fried, whatever if would be, but it would be a healthier alternative that people would begin to like, and if it's popularized enough and you have the right people advertising it, then people would be more inclined to use it.", "4856": "So cleaner, equitable distribution of healthy alternatives, whether it's the medical services or your gym services, your food, and how to become a partner, because the public is not just a passive bystander watching all these things just happen to us, but we have to participate in it too by helping [inaudible] we possibly can.", "4857": "Great, thank you, thank you. So I'm going to let Ketty start off with the last question and then afterwards we have a survey. So the last question is, we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and you'd like other people to hear. So again, for our last question we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'd like for other people to hear. So we'll start off with Ketty with that.", "4858": "I'm going to take away from this conversation the importance of equity. Again, I'm going to stick with this one point because speaking with you ladies today, it resonated to me with new things that are happening, for example, we have the new tele-visit going on because of COVID. Patients cannot go see their doctors. They can't go out. But a lot of patients cannot afford websites. So again, the disparity and the equity of healthcare it just continues, because although you want to offer a patient a tele-visit, that patient may not have a website, so you can't video chat with that patient.", "4859": "So in speaking with you ladies today it just keeps adding on to my head things that we need to be able to compete so we can have good health. So I'm going to take away from here, from this conversation is, that as a community we have to continue to empower each other and to make sure that within our community we have what it takes to survive, so that way we don't have to leave our community to find and to satisfy our needs. To be able to educate. If you know something that is going to be important and is going to improve your neighbor, your family, your co-worker, share it. Again, if you're living in a community that you have the resources that are going to help you survive, all you need is to give your neighbors that referral and say, \"Hey, go down on that street. They have the best fruit market,\" or, \"You know what, there's a doctor two blocks down. He is the best dermatologist.\"", "4860": "So to be able to live in the community where you can refer your neighbor, your friend, to a resource that's going to improve them, physically, emotionally, or whatever the case may be, it can be something that you need for your home that's going to improve the air quality of your home, you want to be able to buy it in your neighborhood. You don't want to able to go somewhere so far or have to order it if you don't have, again, the website. I'm noticing people do not have, can afford, Wifi.", "4861": "I am taking away again, very important for us to live, to survive, is that we have to be able to, doesn't matter our socioeconomical status, we have to be able to live in the world that we're living in; survive the world that we're living in. Because we're living, doesn't mean that we're surviving. I want to thank you ladies for all the wonderful information that you shared and again, it resonates that equity is very important, that we have to strive for it, and that's something that has to have the opportunities for a better life.", "4862": "Great, thanks, Suzanne. Again, let me read the question. Thank you Ketty for that insight. We invite you to share what is the one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'd like for other people to hear.", "4863": "I heard so many things I was trying to... I don't which one is actually viable. I think since I'm a retired educator, to have dialogue with teachers, our retired teachers, about passing on information about health and healthy habits to school children, to include parents in those activities, take home activities. And we've done some of that. But let's say a child in the first grade, second grade, gets an activity to take home and it's like a survey or a game and you can win prizes, something that provides an incentive for the home, something that hopefully the parent can talk and do together, and then bring that back and share it in the classroom and the larger school community so that more healthy habits, how do I eat, how do I get rid of my trash, or how do I keep my hands clean to keep from passing on germs, just basic things. And try to involve some celebrities, people who our children and adults will listen to, so to make it sort of a publicity [inaudible].", "4864": "Great, thank you. Great idea. And Vilma.", "4865": "Yes. I definitely learned a lot from my co-presenters. From Ketty, I've got to admit, I love that idea of empowering the community. I love the idea of saying, \"Hey, we want more healthy choices,\" and just the use of supply and demand, because clearly when that first shop opened up, they must have been making a lot of money, so the next, someone's looking around saying, \"Hey, this community is interested in it.\" So I love that fact that people in the community can empower themselves, be it by talking to the politicians like you recommended or just putting the money out and saying, \"I'm not going to buy the fast food. I'm going to be buying the healthy snacks.\" That was a good one.", "4866": "In terms of Suzette, I love the concept of utilizing the children and just the whole idea of children can teach their parents healthy eating habits. I can just imagine them telling... The children can encourage parents about, I guess a healthy lifestyle in general. So, embrace the educational system so therefore you know that a child who is learning something will be able to talk, not only to their peers, but to their parents. Just be able to appreciate that.", "4867": "I really like the fact that we are talking about our demands. That it's okay to demand things from the politicians, demand things from the healthcare community, saying, \"We expect certain things. We expect equity. There's no reason why people should be treated differently based on a zip code.\" It's now become a right so we are standing up for our rights and I think it's healthy. We just have to figure out a way of making sure that they understand, they meaning this whole group of people, that they are accountable to the community at large.", "4868": "Well ladies, I want to thank you for your time and energy. These are all the questions we have for you. Do you have any closing thoughts that you'd like to share or other general reflections on the conversation? While you think about that, let me just remind you of what will happen with the thoughts you just shared. These recordings will be transcribed, indexed, and eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in the Local Voices Network. They will also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Department of Health.", "4869": "We encourage you to spread the word about the Local Voices Network. If you want to convene another group of friends to participate, or know of others who want to participate, you can go to the website, lvn.org, and I'll send a email out for that. Please also make sure you send me your mailing address for your gift card so we can get those out to you today. Anyone have any questions or closing thoughts, and meanwhile Yule, I know you have a survey. The survey takes about five minutes. We don't have to be on the Zoom call, but if you could take the additional five minutes to answer the survey that would be great. Okay, can everyone see Yule posted the link to the survey in the chat?", "4870": "Yes. Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "4871": "Yes, everyone can see that? I'll also send it in a email.", "4872": "Okay, good.", "4873": "... this conversation. Great. This meeting is now being recorded now. Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation.", "4874": "We've already begun recording. I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded, and the audio will become part of the Local Voices Network collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each others' lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policy-makers, and members of the media.", "4875": "Let me just see. I believe I got a notification somebody's joining.", "4876": "Yeah, it said Jeffrey was coming, and I think his phone ... He's probably got girls calling him.", "4877": "Sounds good. To this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our position [inaudible] issues. In this conversation, you are invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community rather than sharing any personal health information.", "4878": "This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we will be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public.", "4879": "As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media, and to improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation, and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website, or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media.", "4880": "Please only share what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\" So I'll need everybody to unmute themselves and say I'll agree. I'll start off. I agree.", "4881": "I agree.", "4882": "I agree.", "4883": "Thank you, Deandra. Thank you, Liam.", "4884": "Yeah, I agree too.", "4885": "All right, Jeffrey. Thank you. And last but not least, Daryl?", "4886": "Yes.", "4887": "Do you agree to these terms and conditions?", "4888": "Yes.", "4889": "All right. Thank you, Daryl. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance both to share and to learn from others in this conversation, and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're also in the materials we sent with your confirmation email. Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. That's one. Two, allow others to speak for themselves. Three, share the time; allow others to finish speaking; take turns. Four, stay curious; ask honest questions. Five, pause; take time for reflection. Six, listen generously; assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. Seven, when possible, close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone okay with these guidelines, or is there anything that you would like to add or change?", "4890": "I would go with that, what you said before.", "4891": "Okay, so that sounds good, right? Is that okay with everyone?", "4892": "That's fine with me.", "4893": "All right. Daryl is ...", "4894": "That's okay with me.", "4895": "Okay, all right. Is there anything that you would like to change, Daryl, at all?", "4896": "No.", "4897": "Okay, all right. For the ease of this virtual conversation, we are going to use a modified circle, or process, where each person will take a turn. We figured that out, and it's already been posted. To begin, we'd like to just a quick round of introductions, all right? So please share your first name, or a pseudonym. In addition to your first name, please share a little bit of background about who you are, where you live, and what you do, and then a value that's important to you.", "4898": "So I'll start off. My name is Richard. I am a marketing specialist at Young Adult Institute. I live in the Bronx. I lived in the Bronx my entire life. I've been working at YAI for about almost two and a half years now, almost three years.", "4899": "Wow.", "4900": "Yeah, it's been some time. And a value that I hold important to me ... So last week, I was talking a little bit more about accountability. I think, this week, a value that I hold important to me is respect; is having respect for everyone. Respect goes both ways. It's kind of impossible to expect respect if you don't give I out first. That's something that I really value.", "4901": "So next would be Deandra, all right? So start off with a little introduction about yourself: your name, where you live, what you do, are you currently working right now, and then a value that's important to you.", "4902": "[inaudible] backwards?", "4903": "Yeah, you can say-", "4904": "Can I do it backwards?", "4905": "Would you like to end with your name, or did you mean just go in a different order?", "4906": "Go in a different order.", "4907": "Okay, you'd like to end with your name?", "4908": "Yeah.", "4909": "Oh, go in a different order? Okay.", "4910": "Mm-hmm (affirmative).", "4911": "Okay, how about we just skip over you, and we'll just go to Jeffrey. Jeffrey?", "4912": "Hi, my first name is Jeffrey. My last name is [Resnick] I do cooking. I do laundry; my room. Actually, right now, I have a wife. Her name is Nicole. I'm going to get married soon. I will invite you guys to my wedding. My background check is I play basketball. I'm a defense guy; I'm a offense guy. I block shots.", "4913": "Nice.", "4914": "Yeah.", "4915": "All right, thank you. Then, I'm sorry, if you didn't tell me what ... What's an important value to you? (silence) Jeffrey, do you need more time thinking about that?", "4916": "Yeah.", "4917": "Okay, all right. So we'll skip over, and we'll go to Daryl. Hey, Daryl.", "4918": "Yes?", "4919": "Can you give us a quick introduction about yourself: your name; where you currently live. You don't have to use your last name. Tell us what you're currently doing if you're working. And then, what's a value that's important to you?", "4920": "My name is Daryl. I live in Mount Vernon.", "4921": "All right. What are you currently doing, Daryl?", "4922": "Going to get a job at the [inaudible 00:08:54].", "4923": "Okay. All right. What's a value that's important to you? (silence)", "4924": "My connection cut out on that last part. I saw that you opened your mouth, but I couldn't hear it. Daryl, what was the last thing about values?", "4925": "Cleaning.", "4926": "Okay, good.", "4927": "A clean house. Nice [inaudible 00:10:00]. A clean room will equal a clean mindset in life.", "4928": "Thank you Liam. All right, so before we go to [inaudible 00:10:13], Deandra, did you want to provide your introduction now, or did you want to wait again?", "4929": "No, I'll do it now.", "4930": "Okay. All right, thank you.", "4931": "My name is Deandra Brown. I live in Queens, New York. I'm currently unemployed right now. My important value would be ... I'll have to say family.", "4932": "Family, all right. Wonderful. Okay. Liam, did you want to finish us off?", "4933": "Hey, my name's Liam O'Connell. I live in Queens, New York. I work for YAI as an employment specialist, and something that I value is family and teamwork.", "4934": "Great, great. All right, thank you, Liam. Thank you. The next thing we'd like to do is invite you to share a little bit more about yourself. Since we're going to go a little bit more into the health and wellbeing route, and that's kind of the basis of this conversation today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and wellbeing look and feel like to you.", "4935": "Last week ... And I'll use the same story again. Last week, I touched a little bit about my dietary changes, and how I've cut meat out of my diet, and how that's positively affected me. I've been sick for as long as I can remember, especially during the wintertime. Ever since changing my diet, that's been something that I haven't suffered from. I'm definitely thankful for that.", "4936": "Part of the question is: Think of a time, or place, or story where you felt that you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. So we've altered that question to really focus on the past couple of months during the COVID-19 crisis. So I'll start off. A time that I felt my healthiest during this COVID-19 crisis was a switch to just drinking water and tea, mainly. I may mix in a ginger ale here and there, but, for the most part, I switched from drinking juice and drinks with sugar in it to sugarless teas and water. That was a commitment. That was a commitment that I made the first couple weeks into the quarantine. Since I wouldn't be outside an active as much, I figured I'd make some sacrifices while I was home. So just switching to sugarless drinks has definitely been a time during the past couple of months that I've made a health-conscious choice.", "4937": "All right, so, next, I'm going to ask Deandra, if you're comfortable with answering. Can you tell the group a time during the past couple of months, or weeks, during this COVID-19 crisis that you felt at your healthiest? When did you feel your healthiest?", "4938": "I would have to say today, because I'm always healthy.", "4939": "Oh, great.", "4940": "Yeah, but there's really nothing wrong. I just stay healthy. Not the-", "4941": "[inaudible 00:13:52]. All right, go ahead.", "4942": "Yeah, the type of drinks I'm drinking is mostly water. I like flavored water too, like seltzer water. Yeah, I probably drink that.", "4943": "Seltzer water, okay.", "4944": "Yeah. That's about it.", "4945": "All right, sounds good. Thank you. All right, Jeffrey?", "4946": "All right, so I drink coffee in the morning.", "4947": "Coffee, okay.", "4948": "I drink water, seltzer water.", "4949": "Seltzer water?", "4950": "Yep.", "4951": "Okay. All right, so to kind of expand on that a little bit, since I see the focus is on drinks, are there other things that you've done over the past couple of weeks just to be a little bit healthy here?", "4952": "I been doing exercise every day.", "4953": "Exercise? All right, what kind of exercise?", "4954": "Actually, I do classes on [inaudible 00:14:53].", "4955": "Okay.", "4956": "Karaoke.", "4957": "Is that it?", "4958": "Then-", "4959": "Karaoke?", "4960": "I'm the king of that, yep.", "4961": "Okay.", "4962": "If this could be done, would we both have a contest, maybe I could win it.", "4963": "Okay. All right, I'll be looking forward to that. Thank you. Thank you, appreciate it.", "4964": "Jeffrey, are you still practicing martial arts or karate?", "4965": "I could do karate. And I do boxing too.", "4966": "Okay, all right. Next, Daryl.", "4967": "Yes?", "4968": "All right, Daryl, what choices over the past couple week or months have you done to kind of promote a healthier lifestyle? (silence) Do you need some time, or do you want me to tell you about what I did again?", "4969": "Yes.", "4970": "Okay, so I was telling the group about how I usually like drinking a lot of drinks with sugar in it. So this past couple of weeks, I've been cutting out the drinks with sugar and replacing it with water and tea, and I'm not using as much honey or sugar in my tea. That's actually helped me feel a little bit better. So I've been cutting back as a sacrifice since I'm not really outside as active anymore.", "4971": "What kind of sugary drinks were you drinking before?", "4972": "Oh my goodness, all right, so I usually ... I used to mix-", "4973": "Like soda or-", "4974": "Oh. Oh yeah, yeah. I was going to get into detail, but, yeah, basically, soda and juices, Arizonas. I was a big ... I drank Arizonas a lot. What else? Oh, the teas, I would squeeze half a bottle of honey in my tea. It was ridiculous. Now that I think about it, I think of how unhealthy those habits were. It was definitely good to cut back on it.", "4975": "So, Daryl, that's the example that I used, that I've made the sacrifice of just cutting back on sugary drinks. What are some things that you've done over the past couple weeks? Daryl, do you want us to skip the question?", "4976": "Yes.", "4977": "Okay. All right, sounds good. Liam, would you like to finish that off for us?", "4978": "Is it my turn, guys?", "4979": "Yeah, yeah.", "4980": "Oh.", "4981": "Hey. So the questions what is healthy to you?", "4982": "Yep, yep, or what changes have you made over the past couple weeks to just be more healthy?", "4983": "Well, at 7:00 PM every day since the coronavirus started, we watch Jeopardy. And we don't just watch Jeopardy, we play along and vote[inaudible 00:19:04]. My wife and I answer the questions, and that's a good way to-", "4984": "I see your wife.", "4985": "You learn something new every day. Yeah, you'll learn something new every day. That's good for the mental exercises. You'll always learn something if you watch Jeopardy. Jeopardy is on channel seven at 7:00 PM, Monday through Friday. I never watched Jeopardy before COVID-19, but now we've been doing that. So that's something new.", "4986": "I've also been running a little bit more and trying to exercise every day, at least a little bit of excercise, a little bit of physical activity. I think I've felt my healthiest after a nice, long run. I kind of like what you guys said about staying away from sugary drinks and bad drinks. I'm trying to do that too. I had a soda last week, but I'm going to try not to have a soda tonight. But that's pretty much it.", "4987": "What's up big, Jeff?", "4988": "I'm all right.", "4989": "Okay. All right, thank you. Okay, so we want to move onto conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and wellbeing in your community. We've altered this part of the discussion as well. For the next part of this conversation, we'll move on from the format of taking turns, to a more natural back-and-forth conversation. Given that, we will still follow some type of order, but we do want to encourage more of a back-and-forth conversation. So if you feel like there is a comment or a question that you have for somebody for anything that they may say, please feel free to add your input or ask you question, okay? So we are encouraging an open conversation. All right.", "4990": "What, in your community, is working well to support your health and wellbeing? Think about the past couple of weeks and months. What have you seen in your community that's promoting health and wellbeing? And a more specific question for our group is: What type of changes would you like to see for job development moving forward?", "4991": "So I'll start things off. Given the past couple of weeks, as you know, a lot of jobs have been eliminated. A lot of positions have been eliminated. People have not been returning to work. So there are a lot of question marks about how jobs will be looking moving forward. What I would like to see, if I wasn't a job developer, is I would like to see people such as myself, the employment specialists, kind of going out there now to see what the climate is like; to see what jobs are available.", "4992": "For example, a couple of weeks ago, we didn't believe that Marshalls would be opening up again, but we did believe that J. C. Penney was, and I've been hearing that J. C. Penny is closed and that Marshalls is opening up.", "4993": "Right.", "4994": "So it's a completely flipped perspective from just the last couple of weeks. Oh, Jeffrey, did you have a point?", "4995": "Yes, I know ... I got a text from TJ Maxx and Marshalls.", "4996": "TJ Maxx and Marshalls? And, as a job developer, that's all I like to hear. So you said that TJ Maxx and Marshalls are hiring?", "4997": "Jeffrey works at Marshalls in Brooklyn outside the Barclays Center. Have they told you to come back to work yet, Jeff?", "4998": "They text me.", "4999": "Okay.", "5000": "Do you remember what the text message said?", "5001": "I think that my dad called the supervisor.", "5002": "Okay, I'm going to call your dad after this. I have the call list.", "5003": "Yeah.", "5004": "Okay, all right. All right, well, thank you.", "5005": "[crosstalk 00:23:00].", "5006": "Thank you. And that's what we want to encourage is that open conversation, all right? So next is Deandra.", "5007": "Yes.", "5008": "I'll rephrase the question for you. What would you like to see, moving forward, as far as job development? Now that the virus and the pandemic ... Not the virus, the pandemic has kind of slowed down a little bit. It's not over. We still want to excercise caution. But now that people are starting to talk about job development more and going back into the community, what are some things that you would like to see from your job developers?", "5009": "I would say interaction.", "5010": "More interpersonal interaction?", "5011": "Yeah.", "5012": "Okay. Just to elaborate a little bit, do you mean interaction within the job developers and companies, so potential hires, or more interaction between you yourself and the job developer? What type of interaction are you looking to see more of?", "5013": "I would say the second one, though.", "5014": "Okay, so more interaction between you yourself and the job developer, correct?", "5015": "Yeah.", "5016": "Okay, all right. Sounds good, and thank you for voicing that. Okay. Next, Jeffrey?", "5017": "Yeah, am I here?", "5018": "Yeah.", "5019": "What would I say? Back to you. Sorry about that.", "5020": "Do you want me to rephrase it? Do you want me to ask the question again?", "5021": "Yeah.", "5022": "Okay. All right, so as you know, everybody's been home for the past couple of months, right?", "5023": "Two weeks.", "5024": "What would you like ... A little bit more than two weeks, but, you know, yeah. We've been home for some time, right? What would you like to see out of your job developer moving forward now that things are starting to slow down a bit?", "5025": "I know I missing Marshalls, but I'm still waiting for my schedule for this week, if this could be done, and [inaudible 00:25:49].", "5026": "Okay, okay. So what I-", "5027": "That's [inaudible 00:26:01].", "5028": "Oh, go ahead. Go ahead, sorry.", "5029": "I hope to get a call from Marshalls-", "5030": "So what I'm getting from that is-", "5031": "... let me know [inaudible] a job in Manhattan. So I hope to get that call, too, from there. I've been doing my job club on Wednesday. Get update of COVID-19 and the cases. I'm hoping they call me back to work. Go back [inaudible] with the COVID.", "5032": "That's good, Jeffrey.", "5033": "Yeah. Yep.", "5034": "Okay, yes. Sorry about that. I didn't know you was finished, because my connection is a little hazy. Okay. Daryl, your next. All right, so, Daryl, what ... I'm going to ask the question again for you. Since you've been home for the past couple of months, and it's been a while since you've seen me, what is something that you would like to see from me, moving forward, now that we're kind of moving on from the initial panic from the pandemic? What are some things you'd like to see from a job developer, such as myself, moving forward? What can we do to help you get into that transition?", "5035": "Help me to ... Help for me to focus.", "5036": "Okay, all right. I actually did a individualized workshop with a gentleman earlier today, and we just reviewed a video on workplace etiquette. But if we can touch base and do something kind of remote over focusing, we can definitely work that out. All right. So you and I will be in touch after this conversation. I'll reach out to Mrs. [Calfee 00:28:18], all right? So thank you.", "5037": "And Liam, if you had any input for that last part?", "5038": "Hey, guys. Sorry, I'm on the phone with Jeffrey's dad. Basically, I want to get out in the community, and kind of test the waters, and see who's hiring, and see what types of work is available for you guys, and the best way to go about that. Basically, that's what I want to do, and I also want to go close to your house to job-develop.", "5039": "All right. Okay, so now we're moving on to the next section, which will be raising your voices. Not raising your voices literally, just kind of a [inaudible] ... This section will focus more on promoting what your final thoughts would be, because we're almost ready to wrap this up.", "5040": "So now we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to kind of raise your voice-", "5041": "[crosstalk 00:29:27].", "5042": "... beyond this group. There are two questions that we're going to explore here, all right? What is one thing that you would want to be heard from you to your local representatives? So think of a mayor or a governor. What's one think that you would like to say that you would like to see changed? And then, I you can ask a question-", "5043": "Back to you. Sorry about that.", "5044": "I'm sorry, Jeffrey. What was that?", "5045": "No, I'm okay.", "5046": "You're okay? All right.", "5047": "[crosstalk] my other [crosstalk 00:30:04].", "5048": "And then, so the next part, a question ... Okay, we'll wrap this up quick, because we're almost out of time.", "5049": "All right.", "5050": "So, for the next question, is: If you could ask a question to another group just like this who are gathering, what would it be? I'll start this off, and I'll say if there's one thing that I would like for a local representative to understand or to see about our groups that we have is that we do have a group of well-rounded individuals who are looking to work. I'd like to see more initiatives as far as creating opportunities for everybody as a whole. I believe that's kind of the stance that I had last week, and that's something that I've thought about, and that's something that Liam and I, as well as everybody else, even the representatives at Local Voices Network, that's something that we all kind of work collectively to do, is just to find more opportunity for everybody.", "5051": "The basis of this conversation, the reason for this and last week's conversation and all other conversations, is to, overall, raise our overall, raise our overall collective voice, and to bring to light common issues that we face. YAI's involvement with Local Voices Network is to kind of showcase the brilliant minds that we have here that are really just looking to find an opportunity for work. And that's it. That's kind of what I would hope our local representative can hear.", "5052": "So, Deandra.", "5053": "Yes?", "5054": "Next is you, and I'll say the question again. Do you need me to say the question again, or do you understand?", "5055": "I kind of, sort of understand it a little bit.", "5056": "[inaudible] I can say it over. You can pick either question. I'll ask you what's one thing you'd want your local representative to hear from you, or you can answer: What's a question that you would ask another group just like this, who is going to meet up later? What's a question that you would ask for them?", "5057": "I'm going to be on the first one, the first question.", "5058": "The first one? Okay, so what is a question that you would have for your local representative, your mayor? Okay, yeah, so what's your question?", "5059": "For the mayor?", "5060": "What would you ask your local representative? Yeah.", "5061": "Oh, yeah, I would ask them if ... I would like to ask if ... I just want to see the world change, because it's not looking good right now.", "5062": "I'll wait.", "5063": "Okay, all right.", "5064": "[crosstalk 00:33:23].", "5065": "Okay, so Jeffrey, you said you wanted to wait? You want me to come back to you?", "5066": "No, I'm right here.", "5067": "Oh, okay. So, Jeffrey, so choose a question that you would like to ask or answer. The first one is: What's something that you would want your local representative to hear, or you could either ask a question of ... What would you ask another group that would be meeting here just like this?", "5068": "Okay, so ... Okay, so if I was the president ...", "5069": "Okay.", "5070": "I could be on the news, and tell about sports.", "5071": "That's what you ... Okay.", "5072": "That's what I want.", "5073": "That's what you wanted to do? All right, that works.", "5074": "Basketball.", "5075": "Daryl?", "5076": "Yes?", "5077": "All right, one second. All right, and, Jeffrey, are you finished, or was there something else you wanted to add to that?", "5078": "No, I'm done.", "5079": "Okay, thank you. Daryl, so you could choose either one that you want to answer. You can either ask: What's one thing that you would want a local representative to hear or take from this conversation? Or you could ask: What's a question that you would have for a future group that would meet for conversation like this? Which one sounds better to you to kind of elaborate on?", "5080": "Sorry about that, guys. Jeffrey, I just got off the phone with your dad, and you're in big trouble, man. Just kidding.", "5081": "What a good news.", "5082": "Liam, we're at Daryl. We're actually at the last part of the question.", "5083": "All right, sorry, Daryl. You hit it.", "5084": "All right.", "5085": "Yeah, Daryl, is there a question or is there a point that you would want a local representative, from this conversation, to take away, or is there a question that you would have for another group like this?", "5086": "Have a question.", "5087": "Okay. What's a question that you would ask for another group meeting here like this?", "5088": "Okay, I got my [inaudible] so I can get in. Okay. Am I here?", "5089": "Hey, Daryl?", "5090": "Yeah?", "5091": "Is there anything that you would want to know from a conversation like this that you would ask another group?", "5092": "Yes.", "5093": "Okay, what's something that you would like to know, or ... Yeah, what's a question that you would ask a group like this? Think of a question, and then tell the rest of us. (silence)", "5094": "I don't know if it's my connection, but I'm not hearing anything. Daryl, if you'd like, we can switch to another question? That work?", "5095": "Yes.", "5096": "Okay. What is a question that you would have for that mayor of Mount Vernon?", "5097": "The mayor of Mount Vernon. Good question.", "5098": "Thank you. It's okay if you want us to move on. Liam?", "5099": "Yes.", "5100": "All right, so Daryl's finished with his turn. Did you have any final input for that last question, kind of the question of whether you have a question for a group later, or what you would want your local representative to take from this discussion?", "5101": "I would probably ask about regulations that keep in mind that there are healthy people and there are sick people, and people need to regulate their social activities depending on their own personal health, and also don't close down everything for everyone, because then I think it's starting to cause [inaudible] be depressed and things. Maybe open up the parks and things like that, but also have a better way of handling COVID-19, and social distancing, and things like that. And also, maybe like, \"When is there a cure or some sort of treatment so we don't have to worry about this anymore?\"", "5102": "And, yeah, he's upset about it too.", "5103": "Hey, cutie.", "5104": "Hi.", "5105": "[inaudible 00:40:26]. Hey.", "5106": "All right. Okay. If nobody has any final remarks on that, I'll go ahead and I'll read the conclusion, and then I'll mute for the background noise, all right? So I'm going to mute everybody. All right.", "5107": "Those are all the questions that we have for you. If there are any closing thoughts that you'd like to share or any other general reflections, please raise your hand on the bottom right corner, or you can just show me by a show of hands. But if not, just a reminder of what will happen with the thoughts you just shared. These recordings will be transcribed, indexed, and eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in the Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Health Department.", "5108": "We encourage you to spread the word about the Local Voices Network. If you want to convene another group of friends to participate or know of others who want to participate, please go to lvn.org. Thank-", "5109": "This conversation... I want to welcome you guys to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thanks for agreeing to participate in this conversation. Ooh. Continue, sorry. I have begun recording at this time and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. Oh, my nose is about to leak, child. Sorry, y'all.", "5110": "There are three main parts of this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another. Third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we will lift up the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policymakers, and members of the media. To end this, to this end, sorry, to this end, we are inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experiences rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues.", "5111": "In this conversation, you are invited to share your stories about your experiences with the health and well-being of your community rather than sharing any personal health information. Now this conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you are providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "5112": "This is a public conversation and portions of it may appear in the local newspaper or website or to be broadcast in a local radio station or appear elsewhere including other forms of media. So please share only what you are comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understood and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\" Now, usually, I just want to say we're going to go in an order when I ask certain questions, so we'll all be on the same page. So let me write this down, because sometimes [inaudible 00:03:02]. So the first will be Terrence, [inaudible 00:03:05]. Then it will be Teddy. Then it will be DeShawn, then Carlton, all right? So just go Teddy, DeShawn, and Carlton, okay?", "5113": "So at this time, again, if you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree,\" starting with Terrence.", "5114": "Do we still have the option to pass on certain questions?", "5115": "Yes.", "5116": "I agree.", "5117": "Teddy?", "5118": "I agree.", "5119": "DeShawn?", "5120": "I agree. I'm sorry.", "5121": "Okay. And Carlton?", "5122": "I agree.", "5123": "We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and to learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're also on the materials we sent with your confirmation email. So number one, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Number two, allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time, allow others to finish speaking, take turns, stay curious, ask honest questions, pause. Take time to reflect. Listen... Oh, sorry, y'all. I'm leaking all over the place. Listen generously, assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have impact. When possible, close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications and put your phone on silent, okay?", "5124": "Now is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything you would like to add or to change? [inaudible]", "5125": "I didn't hear you really, like for a quick second what you said.", "5126": "Everything or...", "5127": "Oh no, my speaker... Wait, hold on, my speaker.", "5128": "You can't hear us?", "5129": "Boom, go, Reggie, what'd you say?", "5130": "Okay. So the last thing I said was, with the guidelines that I just talked about, is there anything that you would like to change or add to it?", "5131": "No.", "5132": "Okay. So again, you guys know the order, right?", "5133": "Yes.", "5134": "For the ease of this virtual conversation, we are going to use a modified circle process where each person will take a turn. I'm going to post the order in which people will be invited to respond. I don't feel like I should post that, because we already know what the order is. All right? So just to begin, I want to do a quick round of introductions, so please just share your first name. In addition to your first name, a little bit of a background info about who you are, like where you live or what you do, and a value that is important to you and how is it related to what brought you here today. For the first round, I'll start. And if you guys want me to repeat it, I can repeat it.", "5135": "So my name's Reggie. A little bit of background of myself, I'm from Long Island. I moved to the Bronx, where I live now. I work for a medical center, [inaudible] and as you guys know, I coordinate a community-based intervention [inaudible 00:06:50]. And the value that brought me here today and how it's related to why I'm here today is the value of making sure our voices are heard. It's the same mission as empowerment, and I think it's so important, especially with the men in our community, to make sure that our voices are heard no matter what, because I feel like, well, for me, I felt like I was silent growing up and this is why I can't be quiet now.", "5136": "Disco, it's on you. So again, just your name, a little bit of background about who you are, like where you live or what you do, and a value that is important to you and how it's related to what brought you here today.", "5137": "Hey, everyone, my name is Terrence. A lot of people know me as Disco. I'm born and raised from Harlem, New York. I'm a professional dancer with the Jose Limon Dance Company based in New York City. A value that has brought me here today, besides Reggie calling me, was I think I believe dance changes lives in many, many facets, I think spiritually, I think emotionally. I think it does bring those who are underprivileged and in low income communities and who seem to have a struggling childhood, I've watched the profession of dance really 180 their live and their career and put them on a better track than they were at that point. So I guess I'm here to support the arts and the way that the arts can impact us.", "5138": "Thank you. Teddy?", "5139": "Okay, so my name is Teddy. Everyone calls me a lot of things. So a little background about myself, I am Bronx born and raised. I have been working in the HIV prevention field for, I want to say 10 years or so. What else? Something that... What was it? Something that brings... I can't hear you, you're muted, babe.", "5140": "A value that is important to you.", "5141": "Oh, yeah.", "5142": "And how it [crosstalk] brought you here today.", "5143": "A value that is important to me is honesty. I think that something that I witness in the field that I work in is that people are afraid to talk about their sexual health or anything else openly and honestly with their provider, and they forget that without honesty, we can't help you if we don't know what the problem is. So if you're not telling us that you had an orgy with 12 people last night, then we can't really help you with whatever those concerns are. We need to know what you're doing so that we can help you [inaudible 00:09:40]. So honesty is a very big value for me.", "5144": "Honesty. Thank you. DeShawn?", "5145": "Hi, you just said my name, but my name is DeShawn. I was born in Queens, shout out to Queens. [inaudible] But I live in Brooklyn. I'm a [inaudible 00:10:02]... I'm so nervous, I don't know why. I'm a security guard at a homeless shelter, so I work with homeless people and all types of people. So a value that brought me here today is people. I'm a people's person. I want to learn more and I want to help others out. So I would just say people in general. People's lives. I love people.", "5146": "Thank you. Carlton?", "5147": "I'm Carlton [Parrot 00:10:38]. I was born and raised in Queens. I currently work at [inaudible 00:10:47]. I work as a nurse, an emergency room nurse. I've been an emergency room nurse for two years and I've been a nurse in general for about three years now, and what brought me here today is Reggie, he asked me to come and talk, and I feel honored. Thank you, Reggie. One of the things that I value is honesty, like Sebastian, or... I don't know, how did you introduce yourself? Sebastian or Teddy, however you know him. I really value honesty because nowadays, we have to be honest with not only other people, but we have to be honest with ourselves, and I feel like many of us have a problem with that and when it comes to healthcare, like Teddy said, it leads to issues because we want to help you and if you're not being honest with yourself, then you're definitely not going to be honest with us. So moving forward, let's try and be honest with ourselves, you know? So yeah.", "5148": "Thank you. Okay. I apologize, so I think Teddy, you were a little gone. If you want to change your name, you can. You hover over it and then you change it, or if you just want to delete it in itself.", "5149": "I can't [inaudible] after the call is over, so it is what it is at this point.", "5150": "Oh, okay, okay. But if you want us to identify as Sebastian, we will. Would you want us to call you Sebastian? Okay, not a problem. So the next thing we would like to do is to invite you to share a little bit about yourself, since we'll be talking about health and well-being today. I'd like to invite you to take a minute and think about what health and well-being look like and feel like to you. So next, think of a time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. So I want you guys to take a minute. I'll repeat the question again, okay? Since we're, again, talking about health and well-being today, we want to invite you guys to think more about health and well-being, what it would look like and feel like to you.", "5151": "So think of a time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. And then of course, whenever you're ready, Terrence, if you got to take a minute, you can. I will also say this, I want you guys to think about when you can remember about what you felt, I'm sorry, what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, what were some of the factors that supported your health and wellness at the time, how did you feel? So again, just a place, story, or time where you felt that your health was in the best time. I'm sorry, y'all. This nose congestion is bothering me. Again, a place or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of health and wellness, so whenever you're ready, just go.", "5152": "So I've been a professional dancer since... I started dancing in 2007 professionally and I've been going ever since then. I graduated from Fordham University, so I had a real rigorous training. Then right after that, I was dancing for a bunch of different companies. So health-wise, I strongly believe when I'm in season, so in season is like when you're contracted and you're rehearsing and preparing for different shows or tours, I feel like my health and wellness is at its top then, I think because of the respect I have for the art. So I'm saying that to say one, we're rehearsing all day, so physically I'm very active. It would be equivalent to going to the gym from 9:00 to 5:00, which is a long time.", "5153": "On top of that, because I am preparing for performances or something, that changes I would say my entire lifestyle down to what I'm eating, what time I'm going to sleep in respect of also getting up for rehearsal, overall taking care of my instrument so I can go forth and do my job. So being that I'm a dancer, this body, I only have one. This is my instrument. So I take a lot of pride and a lot of care in what you eat, your sleep cycle, that kind of shaves off who you hang around. It's just a very driven, focused I guess career, and I get a lot of joy. I think being in rehearsal, it does exercise the mind as well, so you're not just getting a physical workout and cleaning, you're kind of cleaning and exercising your brain and different facets that you normally would not.", "5154": "So when I'm in season I guess is when I feel... Did I answer your question?", "5155": "Yes. Again, just to reiterate, it's a time, place, or story where you felt that you were in the best terms as far as health and wellness, and you basically said when you're basically on the road, if I'm not mistaken.", "5156": "Pretty much, yeah.", "5157": "Okay. Sebastian, you had a question? Oh, okay. Well, go ahead, unless you want to pass, unless you want us to come back to you.", "5158": "Oh, I'm ready. So because I've been smoking for so long, I can't remember what a time was when I was fully at my best, but the best I can think of is when I was in my teens and I was a lifeguard, and the reason I think that was the time and place I was at my best was because I wasn't smoking. I wasn't drinking. And like Disco said, I was taking care of my body. I was taking care of what I eat, what times I went to sleep, because I knew I had to be in top physical shape to basically save someone's life, if need be. But I do feel like I was motivated. I had a reason to want to... Let me put the cigarettes away. Let me not smoke. Let me not smoke [inaudible 00:17:23], because I had to be sure I was ready, willing, and able to jump at moment's call.", "5159": "But I think that what I noticed was I could breathe more. When I swam, I wasn't in pain and my body wasn't... I wouldn't catch a cramp in my lung from swimming half a mile, and now I can't swim to save my life. But it definitely took a lot of consideration into other people's well-being more than my own for me to take care of my own well-being, if that makes sense.", "5160": "Thank you. DeShawn?", "5161": "Well, I would say when I was younger, when I was in high school before I met the people I know today, before ballroom, before college, before having my own apartment, before everything that I have now, before bills, I would say that was my point of happiness and health and wellness. My skin looked better. I looked younger. I didn't experience a lot of things that I experience, so I would say back when I was in high school.", "5162": "I just want to get, because you said when you were back in high school, can you remember why you felt that way and what are some stuff that supported that? Why do you feel back then that you were at your healthiest, at your best, excuse me, as far as your health and wellness?", "5163": "I feel that was my best time because once again, I didn't know a lot of people, you know what I mean? As in socializing, having fights and stuff like that. I didn't fight. I wasn't shady at all. I was just happy and young, and trying to make it through high school. So that's why I feel like that was my best. I wouldn't have experienced a lot of things back then [crosstalk 00:19:26].", "5164": "Okay, I think I understand.", "5165": "Sexual, mental, yeah, all that.", "5166": "Yeah, I understand what you're saying. So I just want to reiterate, so basically before all the stuff that you got going on, like ballroom and bills and working, you felt like you were the healthiest because you were basically young in high school and you didn't have that many responsibilities to take care of. Okay. Cool, cool, cool. Carlton?", "5167": "Hey, okay. So the time I'm choosing is actually now. I feel like I'm healthiest now because there are so many different aspects of my life where I feel like I'm improving. [inaudible] I'm exercising, I'm finally gaining weight, which is something I've always struggled with. So physically, I'm healthy. Skin is clear, you know? Socially I'm healthy. I have all these different friends, I'm maintaining relationships, I'm developing new relationships, which is so important, health-wise. I'm getting sleep. I just moved out and got my own apartment, and I have this great job. Everything in my life just seems to be coming together, so all of those different aspects coming together in my life creates this new, vibrant, healthy person that seems to be thriving. So I would say now is the time.", "5168": "Thank you. I was supposed to go, but Yule, do I have to go if I went last time? Let me just say, I felt the healthiest in my life when I was... A lot of people know this, I felt the healthiest, of course I felt the healthiest when I was younger, but I would say as far as my well-being, it's when I went to Job Corps, because Job Corps actually makes you take a test, and I think I was so not comfortable with my provider when I was younger, I wasn't comfortable with my provider at all. So I would not tell him the stuff, like Sebastian said earlier with being honest with your provider, because I was scared. I was scared he was going to tell my mother. I think he was going to judge me if I told him that I was going to have sex with another man.", "5169": "So even though I felt healthy, young, I know once I actually got my results and it was a relief to get my results, I felt healthy because I knew that that was that one thing out of all my health, excuse me, and wellness at that time, which was back in... I'm 31 now, so that was back in 2014 or '15 where I felt the healthiest. That's when I felt like I probably was, as far as health and well-being, maybe not mentally, well, no. I was healthy mentally, but now I'm realizing now that I might not be all there mentally. Maybe that's why I have no relationships. But that's another topic. But yeah, so that's when I felt the healthiest is when I came to the Bronx and they told me about my status. I felt the healthiest then, because that was one of the things that I was so scared to do.", "5170": "Thank you guys for sharing. We want to move on to the... Now does anybody have any comments or anything that they want to add before we move on? Okay. Yes?", "5171": "No, I think we're... Well, I'm good.", "5172": "Okay. So we want to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and well-being in your community. For purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of community broadly and share about either your neighborhood community or your social community. When you are responding to questions, if you are speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what community you are thinking of when you share your story. Excuse me. I've got a few questions to start us off, but we hope this will be a time for some back and forth among you as you share your stories. I invite you to respond to points that resonate for you when they are made by others in the group while being mindful that everyone who wants to participate has an opportunity to do so.", "5173": "So we're going to start with Disco. What in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? Like what are some people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being?", "5174": "I would I guess like to shout out this organization called Harkness Center for Dance. They specialize in physio arts or physical therapy for dancers in recovery or injury recovery. I want to shout them out because one, my company specifically is in partnership with them, but they work with you. I guess they have a different contract with each company, so that the main goal, the biggest goal, the biggest concern is the dancer's health. So even if the company might not be under the union of AGMA, they still work with that organization or that foundation to provide physical therapy services for their dancers to help prevent injuries. They come in once or twice a week to wherever your studio is and give you an allotted slot of time that they give each dancer about a 30 to 40 minute physical therapy session if they feel like something is hurting or something's not up for whack.", "5175": "One thing that I do... I think they're so important because a lot of companies aren't a part of AGMA, which means you don't get health insurance. And that is a big dilemma, I feel, in the dance community, because you're getting paid a certain amount and you may feel, \"Oh, dancers may not get paid enough,\" but if you hurt something and you go on medical leave and now I'm stuck with all these big bills. I can't go to the ER, I don't have dental, I don't have these things that when you're younger and you're under your mother's insurance plan or your father's insurance plan, you kind of enjoy the perks. But once that goes away, you're like, \"Oh, shoot.\" Let me not curse on here actually. \"Oh, shoot.\" These are things that are necessary in life, if you want to have a well-rounded, a well healthy mental and physical life.", "5176": "And I believe if you're hiring individuals or if this community, the dance community, is to promote dance to the world and share art with the world, wouldn't you want your artist to be as strong and as healthy as they can be?", "5177": "I like that. Carlton, I see you shaking your head. Does anybody want to comment or just...", "5178": "Well, just me being one of the healthcare providers in our community, I would shake my head because I was agreeing with the whole insurance thing and being under your mother and father's insurance and then having to get your own, that's a big problem in our community because I work in a high poverty area, and we encounter a lot of people who actually don't have insurance, who don't have enough money to pay for their medication, and they end up coming back to the hospital more than twice a week sometimes, and it's really sad to see. So I was just connecting with him in that way.", "5179": "Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you. Sebastian, same question. What is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some people, places, or things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and well-being? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "5180": "I definitely think-", "5181": "We can't hear you.", "5182": "Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?", "5183": "Yes.", "5184": "Okay. [inaudible] but that's okay. So I definitely think that our job at Montefiore as a whole does a lot for our community. Montefiore's slogan is, \"Doing more,\" and something that I hear a lot at my job is we do the most. We're one of the few places in New York City that have been providing care nonstop throughout the pandemic, including preventative care, so not just regular doctors appointments, not just COVID-related things, but we do all around sexual healthcare. And then [inaudible] program do a lot of community work and you guys have been a staple for the community for a long time, so between us as a whole as a part of Montefiore, I think we're doing great, and I think that the community members that we interact with are a part of that growing process. That's all.", "5185": "Okay. Okay. I think I hear-", "5186": "I can't hear you for some reason.", "5187": "Me? Hello? Can you guys hear me? Oh, okay. Sebastian, I want you to share more of an in depth story besides the employment that works well as far as your community. What do you think works really well? Or maybe you did answer me but I didn't... Hello? Hello?", "5188": "I don't know why my headphones aren't working.", "5189": "Well you basically did share basically that. Okay. I guess. [inaudible] All right, no, it's all right. You did answer it actually, now that I'm thinking about it. Did you want to add something else, or no? Okay. DeShawn, do you want me to repeat the question or no?", "5190": "[inaudible] I would say housing works first off because of the street, it's easy to walk in any time, book an appointment. They also do free tests in there, so that's a way to help the community. They also host events there. They also donate to different other companies and different events. They also have therapy there. They also work with the housing, providing help for the homeless. So I would say housing works.", "5191": "Thank you. Thank you. Carlton?", "5192": "What works with working for my community, well, first of all, let me just say that I feel like I'm a part of three different communities. I'm part of the LGBTQ community, I'm a part of the black community, and I don't even know if this is a community itself, but the healthcare community. When it comes to healthcare, I just want to say that I'm appreciative of all the different organizations that have come together to actually help us fight this whole pandemic that we're going through. The many donations that we've received from these people are what's helping us to keep going and to keep fighting, and it helps us to be resilient. Because before, we were working 12 hour shifts with no breaks and whatnot and we were tired. We were exhausted, overwhelmed, and the amount of support that we're getting from these different organizations are really helping with the food and gifts and all that stuff.", "5193": "When it comes to the black community, what seems to be working well for us is social media. Social media has been a really, really big impact. It had a really big impact in our community because of what's going on with the Black Lives Matter... Oh, can you guys hear me?", "5194": "Yes.", "5195": "Oh. With the Black Lives Matter movement. Many of the stuff that is going on today is actually being brought to light because of social media and we're getting the word out. We're able to communicate with each other and come together as a community to show we're not taking this. Enough is enough, you know? We've been able to use that to empower our community, and same thing with the LGBTQ community, because we're going through our own stuff, too, especially with trans [inaudible] being harmed and murdered in the streets. It's something that needs to be addressed, and yeah, I feel like these are some of the things that are really helping my community.", "5196": "Thank you. You kind of answered going into my second question.", "5197": "Oh.", "5198": "Which we'll go back to Disco, no, I actually love that you said that. The second part to this question is what are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. Excuse me. Yes, DeShawn has come back, and he said that it was an accident. Yeah, yes, yes, yes.", "5199": "Wait, what? Oh.", "5200": "The question is...", "5201": "I'll repeat it again, I'm sorry. What are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand a little better.", "5202": "We are not our ancestors and we ain't taking no shit. I have to say that, because... So talking about your own experiences, last [crosstalk] Friday, I wanted to cook, whatever, I was going to my cousin's Juneteenth function or whatever. I'm like, \"So I'll cook the macaroni and cheese, girl.\" And [Byrell 00:35:39], my friend [Byrell] loves my food. So I was like, \"Girl, let me make you a little plate to the side. I'll bring it to your sound check.\" I had no clue what I was going to. I'm just going to drop off this food and go about my life.", "5203": "I get there and I didn't know... She's very active in the ballroom community. I know she's very active in the LGBTQ+ community. But my sister Genovia I guess helped in the House Lives Matter organization helped curate this event in [inaudible 00:36:14]. But it allowed... It wasn't just ballroom-related, it wasn't just dance-related. They allow black and brown bodies of that community to... They had their allotted time to express and comment on what's going on in the world. And it's during a pandemic, during a race war, and it was just really... I stayed for the whole thing. I came to just drop off food and ended up staying for the whole thing because it was so mind-blowing and eye-opening to see so many different shades of people, all cooperating for the better cause, for the greater good, for a bigger purpose. We've all been at events at the pier.", "5204": "I don't know how [inaudible 00:37:06], we've been at [inaudible 00:37:06], we've been at [let-outs 00:37:06] or something, and there's been a rage or somebody's fought and storm, and I was really... My breath was taken away on how everybody cooperated. We have to wear masks because we want everybody to be safe. Everyone was still... Though we were having a good time and the energy was going up and getting higher, everybody worked together to protect each other on top of protesting, whether signally or vocally, I was very blown away on how the youth of this community is really stepping up to the leadership plate, in my eyes. I think that's what I'm getting to. Seeing people I've grown up with stepping into leadership positions and really being vocal is...", "5205": "It makes me feel safe. It gives me hope for the future. It gives me hope for the next day. And progress is being made rapidly. I don't see this dragging out and everybody's a lot of talk and no bite. I'm really happy to be alive and happy to be a part of this generation, as much as I wish I was from the '70s. Any-who.", "5206": "Yeah, I just want to say that I'm really proud of us, too. I was so worried thinking about our generation and whatnot when it came to leadership, because we are, I don't know. We're something else. Especially with social media. I know I just spoke highly about social media, but social media has also been kind of our downfall, too, especially with the millennials. It just seemed like there was no hope for our future, but seeing how everybody is stepping up to the plate, how people are protesting and raising their voices to bring about an issue that needs to be spoken about and it's really inspiring. Yeah, I just wanted to add onto that.", "5207": "Thank you. DeShawn, I'm sorry, who's next? DeShawn, yes.", "5208": "Wouldn't it be Sebastian?", "5209": "I didn't hear the question either.", "5210": "Oh, Sebastian, I'm sorry. [crosstalk]", "5211": "It was supposed to be me before Carlton but Carlton wanted to say something, so I just let him say what he wanted to say. It was okay.", "5212": "Yes, yes, yes. My apologies. Yes. You guys can comment after somebody if you guys do have a comment. I did say that. My apologies. So it is Sebastian, and DeShawn, I will repeat the question.", "5213": "Yes, please repeat the question.", "5214": "Yeah, not a problem. What are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better. Also, please remember when you're talking about the community, please specify what community. Go ahead.", "5215": "I just want to say in part adding to what Disco and Carlton both mentioned earlier, it isn't just one community. It is several, and it's also not one pandemic, it's several. And so Disco mentions it's the coronavirus pandemic and then it's the one that hits a lot harder, the racial pandemic. And so what I can say is that I think our community is very resilient throughout this time. They have [inaudible] masks on buses, trains, streets, socially distancing, fighting people to socially distance from them, and then you have these protests, which we're taking part in because we feel strongly about the issues going on in the country, and people are upset with us because we're not socially distanced.", "5216": "99% of us are wearing masks though, so we're good. We got this. We're paying attention. We know what we're doing, and to be honest, I think it's more of a we're not as afraid of the virus as we are of walking down the street and being shot. So it's giving very much we are going to stand up for both the coronavirus and the racial pandemic and we're going to fight until the fight is over. I've watched people march through streets, through houses, through parks. I've watched the looting happen. I've watched the firework mess going on right now that everybody's hearing about and conspiracies are coming out from. But I think overall, we've done an amazing job at trying to keep things normal in a time that feels so unreal and so un-normal, because the last three months have felt like the longest year ever.", "5217": "I think that we all have... I can speak from our point of view, from the healthcare working, so I would say me, you, and Carlton, and Carlton even more because he's in the ER, we're doing what we have to do. And it's no longer 12 hour shift days, it's no longer all day in PPE. Now things are slowly getting back to normal and we're trying to keep normal as normal as it can be, even though social distancing is normal now. Masks are normal now. Every couple of seconds, taking out your little... is normal now. It's something you thought would be normal before, but it's becoming super normal now. So we on the right track.", "5218": "Thank you.", "5219": "If you guys want to comment, just make sure you either put in a comment or if you want to say something. Yes, DeShawn, would you like me to repeat the question? What are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you want others to understand? And if you can share a story from your experience that makes us understand. Also, I'm not sure why I didn't say it in the beginning, but you do have the option of passing or saying, \"Pass to come back.\" I'm sorry. That's why I feel like this is the old one. I'm sorry. Anyway.", "5220": "You said it.", "5221": "Oh, I did, right? Oh, okay. Thank you.", "5222": "I would say from looting to now having peaceful protests, from killing cops and destroying everything, basically I would say from not thinking well to now actually be thinking, I don't think the masks are normal at all. I still have a 12 hour shift. I wish I was you guys, not having 12 hour shifts. But I just think from looting to not looting, that's amazing. That's resilient. They think more. That was it.", "5223": "Okay. What are you learning more about your community's well-being during this time? What would you say you're learning more about people's well-being in this pandemic and that you want us to understand?", "5224": "Can I pass that one? I got to think. I'm sorry.", "5225": "Okay. [inaudible] No problem. Then it's Carlton. Sorry, y'all. You're on mute.", "5226": "Sorry. Do me a favor, just repeat the question one more time?", "5227": "Not a problem. What are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understands? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "5228": "Well, for one, I know we already mentioned it, but the black community are a very vulnerable community. When I say vulnerable, I mean in need of support, in need of protection, because we're at risk for physical harm nowadays. Like Teddy said, it's hard to... We fear more about losing our life walking down the street than actually contracting the coronavirus. So with that being said, even though we are vulnerable, we are very strong people, especially when we come together. That is so important. People mention this all the time. I don't mean to be stereotypical, but you know how the Asians come together and the Jews come together and they build up their community? The times that we're in right now, it really shows that when we come together, we can make change happen. We can make things happen for ourselves.", "5229": "We are a vulnerable community, but we are very strong and very resilient at the same time, and I just hope that we keep this going. And then I look at the community from a healthcare provider point of view, and I was proud to see how we all came together to help our community, to help our country. We had the coronavirus that was spreading like wildfire, and we all came together to basically try to empower each other and support each other and give each other strength and help each other wherever we needed help in. I was surprised to see that, especially since we never had anything like this before, at least not while we were living. So yeah, I would like to make those comments about those two communities, how they're vulnerable, but when we come together and work together, there's nothing that can stop us, you know? That's what I've learned.", "5230": "Thank you. I'm also going to answer, does anybody want to comment?", "5231": "I think DeShawn is raising his hand?", "5232": "I just called you out.", "5233": "Oh, you guys are going, saying no. What I learned about the community's well-being and resiliency during this pandemic is that people really did not care about their well-being, into the sense that they were putting themselves... I even remember during, so the crazy thing is, this is talking about the pandemic, but the pandemic, the whole police brutality, the whole systematic racism falls into the pandemic because that was also happening during the pandemic, which was still in. So I would say that, to the community, when I say the community, I really just say it's New Yorkers and people who are protesting, whether they were black and white, it's just so interesting how they were willing to put themselves, because one of the reasons why, and I know I spoke to Sebastian about this, one of the reasons why I did not go to the go protests because I was fearful that I was going to get hurt, being that I was a product of police brutality when I was younger.", "5234": "Being that I can be triggered when I see certain things that I'm seeing on social media of police attacking people or just spraying them down, it's for me, I couldn't be there personally for that, because that would have triggered me and it just wouldn't be a safe environment for me and my mental being and all that. So I definitely want people to know that when we really want something, we get it. You understand what I'm saying? When we really want to make change, we get it. I always use this example when I was doing a hosting thing, when people of color, mainly at this site where there's a lot of black people, and they're saying, \"Yes, Black Lives Matter, Black Lives [inaudible 00:50:01],\" I'm like, \"Okay, well, are you registered to vote?\"", "5235": "\"No, I don't believe in that stuff. I don't believe in that stuff.\" \"Do you work?\" \"Yes, I have a part-time job.\" \"You pay taxes?\" \"Yes, I pay taxes.\" \"Okay, so do you know that you're paying for someone's come up? Let's be very clear. Okay, when people come in office, you are paying for their come up, okay? You put them at a different tax bracket, so you're not only helping them, you're helping their families, so that's number one. Number two, people died for us to vote. So if that's not the respect... If you don't even have the respect because you didn't have the right, we as people of color do not have a right to do that. So now you have the right to vote, right? So that in itself should give you the battery to vote.\"", "5236": "But also, you're paying for people to represent you, and a lot of times, and I know this is going to get a little bit off topic, but there are racist Democrats out there. I'm sorry. And I feel that sometimes in society we are brought up a certain way, well, if you believe in this, you're a Democrat. Okay. So growing up, I'm thinking I'm just a Democrat, and I remember before voting now, the last time I voted was for Barack because I wanted to be part of history of making sure there was a black president, right? And I just went into the booth and I just voted for him and everybody else who was Democrat [inaudible] I'm just not knowing I could be putting someone who doesn't believe in my LGBTQ life, who does not understand what it is growing up in a neighborhood that didn't understand why I was being myself and why they'd think that was not the right thing to act like or the right thing to be.", "5237": "So I definitely learned that our community is really, really strong, and I think they're also fed up. I think a lot of times we stay silent to a lot of things, and like I said, I was silent back in the days when I used to go to my provider. And I think people are just fed up with being silent, and what I want people to know is that for me, what all of this pandemic has shown me even more is that you have to stand up for certain things. You have to. You have to speak up for certain things, because even, and I will say this, even I feel like, well, I have people in my immediate circle who have said certain things that could be viewed as either racist, either colorist. I now, sometimes I'll say something and then you let it go because that's, people are, \"Oh, that's who they are, right?\"", "5238": "So every time for me, it's like, oh, that's not me. That's the reflection of them. That's not coming out of my mouth. That's coming out of their mouth. But I think it's really important to correct people nowadays, and to continue to correct them until they are exited out, because I feel like now with this pandemic, we don't have time for the bullshit, okay? We don't got time for that. We don't got time for you not understanding why you should not be calling a certain thing or why you as a professional, especially health professional are rolling your eyes or not trying to give me the best care because of \"your religion or your belief or your culture,\" quote-unquote. So that's just my little thing to think on it.", "5239": "All right, now I would like to bring in the voice of someone who participated in a conversation in the Local Voices Network recently. I want you to imagine that this person is in the room with us and listen closely to their comments. I'll then invite you to share any responses and insights you gained from listening to these comments. Okay? So...", "5240": "Okay. The first things that come to mind, just for the sake of time, is just change, like a systemic change in the way that we do things from a top down level, from the big guys up there that make the decisions to the ones that employ the services, just making sure there's no question that there is social, economic, and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels, and that it affects our health. And if we can do away with that where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals, across the board, that if I'm walking down Corona in my neighborhood and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan. There is going to be no change, same quality of care there. That's the first thing that pops to my head.", "5241": "Would anyone like to share what insights, reactions, or memories came to mind from listening to this?", "5242": "I agree. I agree with if we look at Canada's system or healthcare or certain countries where everyone is being provided, the same thing I agree that that would be beneficial. However, the little catch with that is you have to really... I feel like the first step would be to switch those group of people who are in charge, because the trick can be is they can give everybody, they can make it possible for everybody to have that same healthcare, but you want quality. So you don't want the trick of, okay, we'll give you what you want, but we won't give you quality and we'll still make it available where those with money can still go to their private practices.", "5243": "And I'm someone who goes to private practice on 5th Avenue. I've always had private practice my whole life. My mother's in the medical field. So I was lucky enough that these people were her friends, so it's not like I came from money, you know what I mean? I lucked out to go to private school my whole life, and I'm one who I'd rather go to my primary care doctor on 5th Avenue, because I see how in, where is it, Corona? I don't go to Brooklyn. In Corona, you can be served one way, you know it's the truth. And then on 5th Avenue, you're getting a whole different deal, you know what I mean? I've had times where I've applied for things and I'm using my father's last name and I'm being treated or thought as or imagined as somebody else, but then when I walk into the room, it's like, \"Oh, that's Mr. [Diable 00:57:48].\"", "5244": "Yeah. It's me, and I still want the same services that I should be getting. Everybody's health is important, you know what I mean? Your heart pumps red blood just like mine. So why should I not? So I agree with her, but I just think it has to be really... You have to get that scalpel and really shave off all that fat and really get in there into those details and make sure, once again, we're not being swindled.", "5245": "Thank you. Anybody else want to share?", "5246": "I agree 1,000%, and if I could say Disco took all the words right out of my mouth. It is facts. Everyone deserves the same level of healthcare all across the board, whether you 18 or 99 or just starting on somebody's health insurance, whatever. It should be all the way across the board. Religion, all that other stuff should not play a part in taking care of somebody's life. That's why the Hippocratic Oath is in place, because it says if somebody's in an emergency, regardless of whatever, you have to treat that person to avoid them losing their life to that emergency. But yeah, I think all across the board, everybody deserves the same level of thing, because like Disco said, when you get a little cut right here, it comes out the same color, no matter what person.", "5247": "So regardless of money, sexual identity, religion, say whatever, everybody deserves to have... That's why I like Bernie Sanders, because universal healthcare for everybody.", "5248": "Anybody else want to add to any insights, reactions, memories, Carlton or DeShawn?", "5249": "Just one thing came to my mind. We were talking about equality in healthcare. So I work in an emergency room, and in the emergency room we have different sections. We have a [inaudible] center and then we have all these different areas, and I mostly work in the part where we're at the front lines, like we're the first people that [inaudible] to see when they first come in. We deal with the immediate, immediate emergencies, right? So that includes respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, things like that. Just talking about this just brings me to a conversation I had with one of my other coworkers, how there's a doctor, not going to name who, but there's a doctor who is white who she said that... My coworker said that she noticed that whenever he gets a black patient or somebody of color, he treats them differently.", "5250": "[inaudible] He provides healthcare, right? I don't want to say that... [inaudible] puts more effort into saving somebody that is Caucasian as opposed to somebody who is of color. They'll still get pretty good treatment, but you can tell the difference between how he treats white patients as opposed to how he treats colored patients. And we especially know that with somebody who came in that was in cardiac arrest, their heart stopped and we had to get it going again, they came I like that, and unfortunately we did not get the patient back, but compared to somebody else who is Caucasian who came in as a patient that was in cardiac arrest, there was just so much more effort being put into bringing that person back as opposed to bringing that person of color back.", "5251": "We discussed this afterward. We had a debriefing between just me and my coworker, and we were just like, \"Wow, that's crazy.\" Even though he is providing healthcare to both patients, it's just crazy that he put in that much more effort to try and bring that person back. He spent almost an hour on that Caucasian patient, that white patient, as opposed to the 30 minutes that he spent with the black patient that came in that was in cardiac arrest. It was just really disheartening. I was really disenchanted with that doctor. Hopefully in the future, we can actually do something about that, and me and my coworker and other people can actually come together. Because even though we're nurses and they're doctors, we do have a voice. Everybody has a voice. And we can bring these things to the forefront and hopefully we can make some type of change, because this shouldn't be happening, you know?", "5252": "Thank you for sharing. Yes, Disco?", "5253": "I wanted to touch on that. I don't know if I spoke to you about it, Reggie, personally, but about two weeks ago, I went to my dermatologist, esthetician to do something. I went to go get something removed. Any-who, very light work. I went in there, explained my whole skincare routine, I explained why I wanted something to get fixed. I came in just giving a bunch of information, very small little procedure. This is what I want to do, I'm coming to you for professional information, because I don't know, and I'm hearing a bunch of different ways to get to the same result. Any-who.", "5254": "So she decides that... She [inaudible] from the topic of dermatology and skincare and she's like, \"Oh, well,\" of course, she's blanco, so a Caucasian doctor, and she's like, \"Well, why do you feel these two things define your face and who you are?\" Now she's going into the psychological realm of, \"You know, well, why do you feel that way? I'm going to give you some books for recommendations on self-awareness.\" And I was sitting there really like, one, I'm not using the health insurance that I don't have. So I'm paying you to do your job. I didn't come... if I wanted to see a psychiatrist, I would've went to a psychiatrist. I guess to give more context to it, I'm going to get one small blackhead removed. I'm not coming to get botched up, the nose shaven down, the chin... You know what I mean? Things that may require you to go see something for, it may be a little deeper mentally.", "5255": "So after I explained and she looks at one thing, she said, \"Oh, this is not what you think it is.\" She's like, \"Oh, you're going to need the Kim K method.\" And she started giggling and laughing, as if this was normal. Okay? It cost more money. It required you to do more botching to your face than original. And I was sitting here like, wow. It really resonated with me that I came in as an African American male for one small thing, and now you're judging me and questioning my appointment and my purpose being here, but then your solution to fixing it is to do the same method as this other Caucasian woman and to botch my face up more. And it really just... I was so confused that if I want to do it is an issue and there's something wrong with me mentally, but I should be following this white woman's idea of what beauty is and how she conforms and cleans her face up.", "5256": "And it's okay to do something like that. It's okay to pay the 500 extra dollars and to not... Now you're not mentioning anything about a psychiatrist. Did Kim Kardashian go see one for her mental stability on why she thinks it's okay? You know what I mean? And I don't know, Carlton, you telling that story, it really did resonate with me because I decided to go to a primary care doctor on 5th Avenue instead of researching and going to one of our own. And I personally feel like in that moment, I was like, \"I made the wrong decision.\"", "5257": "We shouldn't feel like that. We shouldn't. I actually went seeking out healthcare advice, and [crosstalk 01:06:35]-", "5258": "I was like, that is so wicked. I come here for one thing and now I'm in my... I'm a Virgo, so I'm always in my head. I'm always questioning, second guessing things. That experience really stuck out to me where I'm questioning now, is this medical center or facility right for me? Is this place here to support, here to provide care for me when I'm coming to spend my dollars to put in your pocket to feed your family?", "5259": "It just sat with me. Because I work hard.", "5260": "Okay. Thank you. Anybody else want to share reflections on the recording? I'll say something real quick. I do agree, obviously. Very interestingly enough, I was in a meeting and they were talking about how leadership needs diversity. Sometimes when you look at leaders, they don't look like us, but I think people sometimes make the misconception, because I was actually on a Zoom call with the council members with the NYPD commissioner, who I did not know was a black man, okay? He's a black man. Granted, he had two of his, what are they called? Constituents? His staff members who are both white, and long story short, they had a day long meeting and when it came to listen to the testimonies of people who were victim of the hands of his staff, they got up and left.", "5261": "Now, they could easily say, \"I have something to do. I have another call.\" But these council members, they asked twice during the call with the testimonies, mind you, the people have to... Oh, sorry, let me see, let me read this. I have to go to work in a few. Okay, not a problem. Hold on. Give me one second. I'm almost done, I promise we're almost done. Long story short, you know I get sidetracked, child, I forgot what I was saying.", "5262": "You were talking about the people, oh, shoot, [inaudible 01:09:07].", "5263": "You were talking about the call and how they could've been-", "5264": "Oh-", "5265": "How they decided to leave at a certain point.", "5266": "Right. They just decided to leave, and I thought not only was that rude, but that showed the character of certain people. When you're a leader of a task force that carries stuff that can end people's life, I just feel like it just showed that he was not caring about the public, and sometimes I feel like a lot of times people will always protect their staff because they feel like the job is so hard and sometimes there are certain loopholes that has to happen to get the job done. So I agree with the recording. I think a lot of time with leaderships, there needs to be diversity.", "5267": "I remember there was an awards show and this lady said something of the lines of, I think it was, I forgot, she had a speech and she basically wanted more diversity. I think it's something when you're an actor, you can ask for a certain percentage to be part of LGBT and people of color. I forgot what that exactly was. I'll remember it later. But yes, I think leadership needs to be diverse. I think it needs to include all types of people from white, black, Spanish, LGBTQ. There needs to be a representation on the table. Now that doesn't mean that all people are going to be good, because like I said, we have an NYPD commissioner who is black, which was very surprising to me, but yes, I definitely do agree.", "5268": "For the sake of purposes of time, I'm going to [crosstalk]", "5269": "I just want to say this last thing with these people in power, in the healthcare, the police department, the fire department, anything when you're dealing with the community or people, I think what has to be brought up now is the priority must be the people.", "5270": "Yes.", "5271": "Absolutely.", "5272": "And that's where we're going wrong, because the [inaudible] their pocket.", "5273": "Mm-hmm (affirmative). So here's a question for more reflection. Given our conversation today, DeShawn, I'll let you go first, given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would it feel like? And I'll let you guys pause. So again, given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would it feel like?", "5274": "New York City would... What would it look like, what would it feel like? If people think about people, I think it would be amazing. Stop being selfish. Actually generally care, you feel me? It's not just a job, you know? Also, by taking care of yourself, too, while helping others. You can't fix nobody and help nobody if you can't help yourself. So help yourself and don't be selfish, [inaudible 01:12:18].", "5275": "Yes, thank you. Disco?", "5276": "That's a hard one to answer when you've grown up in this place this whole time. I've always considered Montreal like the small version of New York City. It looks just like it, but it is so clean and so kept, and I think two parts. I've always noticed that their community, the people of the city, do a big part in maintaining it being kept. It's not just left up to whoever's working for the city, the sanitation, those on the MTA, etc. But it's also the city's organizations and foundations that have changed that and one specifically being is their police department. I've never encountered a department who is for the people. I don't have to give the stories on why I believe they're for the people, but I think it's just a relationship. This is our city. It's a relationship. We both have to put in 100% for it to change. Yeah. I think that's it.", "5277": "Thank you. Sebastian? We'll go to Carlton.", "5278": "I think it look a lot like Canada. Canada, Switzerland, these other places that are doing a lot better than us healthcare-wise. I think we would... I think life would just be so much better. We would be a lot happier, and you'll see that in the streets, how clean the streets are. You'll see that in people's physical health, how people look. You'll see that in communities where there'll be less poverty. There'll be access to [inaudible] aren't readily available to communities. The world would just be... I'll say our country, our country would look a lot better if this was an ideal, perfect, happy world in that aspect.", "5279": "Thank you. I guess Sebastian, are you there? Okay. Well, I'll let him come back. Now we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group. For our last question, we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'd like other people to hear. Sebastian, I'll let them answer this last question and then I'll go back to you. Well, actually, since you're here now, given our conversations today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would it feel like?", "5280": "I don't get that. Say that again? I'm sorry.", "5281": "Here's a question for your reflection. Given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like? What would it feel like?", "5282": "Damn, that's kind of difficult. I think that a New York City where healthcare is given to everyone, a New York City where things are accessible to everyone, if you go to 14th Street kind of New York City parks, they have these fab little activity centers and they always engage in the community. You come to the Bronx, you see the center, but they're not out there engaging in the community. They're not out there trying to engage the kids to play something or do something. It's just very free for all. So if it was like it was mentioned earlier, I think Carlton brought it up, how the doctors treat one patient a certain kind of way and another patient a different kind of way, if everyone was treated the same way, then everybody would have access to the same schooling, the same healthcare, the same everything. If everybody was legit treated equally, then that would be a New York City that I see being completely healthy because everybody would have the access.", "5283": "And don't get me wrong, that's to each his own, because healthy to you or healthy to me are two completely different things, you know what I mean? You could want to be healthy in the sense where you want to go jogging every day and I want to be healthy in the sense where I just drink a gallon of water every day, you know what I mean? So everybody's version of healthy is different. So a New York City that allowed everybody to enjoy and reap the same benefits. I think that would make New York City healthy as a whole.", "5284": "Thank you. Now again, we invite you to think about this conversation as a way for you to raise your voice beyond this group, so again, Disco, for our last question, we invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'll like other people to hear?", "5285": "There are a lot of communities that other communities can get involved with, if that makes any sense, how we were talking about the medical care community, the dance community, ballrooms community, the LGBTQ+ community, in that we don't have to do this alone. It's a pandemic where there's a lot of things happening [inaudible 01:18:23], so don't go toe to toe with something that might have more [inaudible 01:18:30]. I think if we come together, we're stronger together. The ballroom community can definitely hook up more with the healthcare community to fight certain pandemics that have been around for a while, even though we have been doing that work for years. I guess that's just what I'm walking away with today right now, feeling that we have so many different resources and friends that we can connect to to fight the bigger cause, but that you can also reach out to yourself for micro situations.", "5286": "Reggie, how you were saying you didn't want to go to a protest because of how it would trigger you. But now knowing that, okay, and we're all here to support that if that's not for you, that's not for you. But to also let you know that if you do go and when you do see something on YouTube, we are here to help you if you need an out or a space to speak or a space to ping pong ideas off of. Just like it was nice to talk to Carlton and hear that story about how one doctor was more inclined to help one patient over another, and how that resonated with me because it paralleled with the situation I was going through, to have somebody to speak to about that was very reassuring. So to know that we are not alone and just keep climbing on each other.", "5287": "Thank you. Sebastian? All right, we'll go to DeShawn.", "5288": "Can you say the question again?", "5289": "Yeah, not a problem. For our last question, we want to invite you to share what is one thing you heard today that you'll be taking away from this conversation and that you'd like other people to hear?", "5290": "One thing that I took from this conversation is that racism still exists. It's more moderate now. And I just want the people to get from this is that don't be selfish and always stay positive. Join groups like this to learn more information. And yeah, that's all.", "5291": "Thank you. Carlton?", "5292": "Yeah, like what DeShawn said, racism is still prevalent in our communities and I don't know if it's more prevalent or if it's just being brought out into the light now and we can see it more than back in the days. But I just want to speak to everyone, especially our younger community, because it's up to us to change how we respect each other and how we interact with each other. Racism is something that is taught. It's not something that is within our hearts naturally. It's something that is taught. So I think that we just need to keep fighting and we just need to keep supporting and we need to change how things were done back [inaudible 01:22:01]. It's up to us. We're the millennials. We're the new generation, come on, you know? I just hope that we keep fighting and we keep improving.", "5293": "Thank you. DeShawn, you had your hand up?", "5294": "Yeah, so as far as the young people [inaudible 01:22:18], I would say that some of us all have a little platform. We should all use them. And also do not promote fights within the next thing for promoting peace, then police brutality, always be real and always stick to one thing. If you want to be positive, be positive. Don't go fighting with them, you know what I mean? So yeah, that's what I [inaudible 01:22:52]. Also, I think racism plays a part with our own black people versus black people, so that's a big thing, too.", "5295": "Colorism.", "5296": "[inaudible] So I don't think it's just always the whites against the blacks. It's also the black against the black to racism in general. So yeah.", "5297": "Absolutely. Thank you for sharing. Sebastian, are you on the line? Okay. Well, I guess I'll go for myself. [crosstalk]", "5298": "Hey, I'm here, I'm sorry, but I'm working, so I'm a little in and out, in and out, so if I can't answer the question, skip and come back to me.", "5299": "Okay. Okay. Well, okay. Okay. Well, those are all the questions that we have for you. I'll just take that as a pass. Do you have any closing thoughts that you'd like to share or other general reflections on the conversations, or any questions for us? No? Okay. Just a reminder of what will happen with the thoughts you just shared, these recordings will be transcribed, indexed, and eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner, the New York City Health Department. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voices Network. If you want to convene another group of friends to participate or know of others who want to participate, please go to LVN.org.", "5300": "Thank you so much for joining us and sharing your thoughts.", "5301": "Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I have begun recording at this time. I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First will be we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each other's lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another, and third, we want to create a unique listening channel, through which we'll uplift the voices and needs of the community to candidates, local policymakers and members of the media.", "5302": "To this end, we're inviting you to have a different type of conversation. Local Voices Network conversations are focused on stories from our shared, lived experience rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues, and in this conversation you're invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and wellbeing of your community rather than sharing any personal health information if you don't feel comfortable doing so. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually, we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion with a goal of eventually making it accessible to the general public.", "5303": "As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with this mission of fostering conversations in communities and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. This is a public conversation, and portions of it may appear in a local newspaper or website or be broadcast on a local radio station, or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media, so please only share what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. We're going to go around. If you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\"", "5304": "I agree.", "5305": "I agree.", "5306": "All right.", "5307": "I agree.", "5308": "Thank you. Thank you. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation, and to support those goals, we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're speak for yourself and that of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, share the time and allow others to finish speaking, stay curious and ask honest questions, pause if necessary and take time for reflection when needed, listen generously and assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact, and when possible, close all unnecessary programs, applications, put your phone on silent if you can, and just remember to mute out when other people are talking just to avoid feedback. Is everyone on board with these guidelines or is there anything you would like to add or change?", "5309": "No, I'm just silencing our phone for a moment. Hold on.", "5310": "Perfect. Perfect. All right, and for the ease of this virtual conversation, at the beginning we'll use this modified circle process. So we'll go around in the order of Yulia then Ramon, and then Monica just to start it off with a quick round of introductions. But if you do hear something that you resonate with or have something to add that someone else has said, please feel free to chime in at any time. In the circle process at the beginning, you can always pass or ask us to come back to you if you need time to think. So we'll just start with a quick round of introductions. We ask you to share just your first name. In addition to your first name, a little bit of background info about who you are, where you live, what you do, and a value that's important to you and that's related to what brought you to this conversation.", "5311": "I'll start. My name is Yule. I am from Local Voices Network. I am the community builder in New York. I was born and raised in Brooklyn, and yeah, this is what I do. A value that is important to me I would say is family, especially in the time that we're in, this very unique time in history. It's not as if I've neglected my family, but you really realize how much more important it is to stay connected with the ones you love. So that's my value, and I'll pass it to you, Yulia.", "5312": "Okay. My name is Yulia. I live in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, but I grew up in The Bronx. I'm a certified financial planner who works solely with those with disabilities, mostly on benefits. And a value that's important to me is security. I've been thinking about this since I was 14, when I first became disabled, how to protect myself, make sure I always had housing, food, and health insurance. And [inaudible 00:04:58].", "5313": "Thank you. Ramon?", "5314": "Yes. My name is Ramon, and I work for CIDNY, which is the Center for Independence for Disabled of New York, and I'm 57. I became disabled at the age of 30, and before becoming disabled I was a construction worker, so when I became disabled I had to learn all new skills from scratch. Whatever scratch meant back then. It was a new world, so I was introduced to one of the other independent living centers in the beginning, and I worked for them initially until I got involved and finished school and started working for CIDNY. CIDNY I learned, at CIDNY we do a lot of systems change, and when I became disabled I saw that the system wasn't helping or assisting people like me, newly disabled, transition from the old world of work to a new one. And even though they had the mechanisms in place, they wasn't actually advertised or people wasn't, how would I say it? They wasn't promoting them the way they should.", "5315": "I see that CIDNY was one of the type of agencies that did more systems change, and I liked that we did more systems change. I applied for one of the jobs and I've been on board with CIDNY for the last 17 years. I'm one of the senior benefit counselors at CIDNY and I work, CIDNY has two offices, I work out of the Queens office. Even Monica, Monica works on one of... I'll let her share hers, but she works on one of the poll site and stuff, and as you guys know, this Tuesday was voting. We've been doing voting since, with Susan Dooha, since we came aboard, right? We have seen the polling site systems change dramatically. Not to where we want them to be, but we've made some progress, and that's what I like about CIDNY.", "5316": "One more thing. My wife is also disabled, she's deaf or hard of hearing, and if some questions may arise, I may use our both personal experience to share because we have two different... I'm a person in wheelchair, and she's someone that experiences other issues as a person who's hard of hearing. So if you guys don't mind, I may share some of the experience as we go along living our life in this time of pandemic. Sorry, I made that long.", "5317": "No, that's perfect, and thank you. I think that would be perfect to share both you and your wife's experiences together.", "5318": "All right. Thank you.", "5319": "Monica?", "5320": "Hi. My name is Monica, as you know. I had my disability since childhood, and as a result of that, in the early days when we had to try to fit in to society, that was a real problem because we are faced with so many barriers. However, as I got older and became involved in the disability movement, I realized that our voices can help to create a world in which we can fit in and be comfortable.", "5321": "I became a disability advocate from an early age. I grew up in Jamaica and moved to the United States in 19... Well, fully I moved in 2007, fully. I usually go back and forth, but I fully settled in 2007. I got a job with CIDNY because that organization just portrayed the values that were important to me, making system changes, and we, the people who are affected, have a chance to advocate for those changes because we know our lived experiences. So CIDNY was just the perfect place for me.", "5322": "I work as a community outreach organizer there, and one of my main job responsibility is working with our consumer action network, CIDNY Action Network as it is called now, where we teach people to advocate for themselves and to tell their own stories to our legislators and help to bring about changes in systems and policies. So that's very important to me, seeing changes, getting changes in society where we can live a meaningful life as citizens of society.", "5323": "I live in Brooklyn, and as Ramon mentioned, one of the areas that we are involved is voting rights. We've helped to educate people about their voting rights and to talk with legislators to the extent that we brought a lawsuit against the Board of Elections where we got polling sites to be made accessible. So with that, we had to see to the implementation of the Help America Vote Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. So through that bit of legislation, we've been able to secure the necessary changes to encourage people to go out and vote privately and independently. I'm very happy about my job. I see it as something that helps people with disabilities to become independent citizens and to lead a meaningful life.", "5324": "That is awesome, and I thank you all for sharing. Very much appreciate it. We're going to go on to our first question, which is we're going to invite you to share a bit about yourself. Since well be talking about health and wellbeing today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute to think about what health and wellbeing look and feel like to you. So as a start, think of a time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of your health and wellness. Some things to think about, like what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best and what were some of the factors that contributed to that and supported your health and wellness, and overall how did you feel? So we'll go around one at a time and share our stories. Just remember, you don't have to disclose any sensitive information that you're not comfortable with sharing, and of course just don't use other people's names when telling your stories. So I'll give you a minute to just think on that, and Yulia, you're up first when you're ready.", "5325": "Sure. I don't know if I remember all the points of the question, but I will start by saying that I've had multiple sclerosis since I was 14 years old, and that has led me to be legally blind and I use a wheelchair when outdoors, a manual wheelchair, so I push myself most of the time. With a mask I have less energy, so I have to be pushed as well. I have a home aide who's here six hours a day, seven days a week, and she helps me with activities of daily living and really helps me conserve my energy so that I can focus on what's important to me. What I hadn't mentioned before is that I'm a board member at CIDNY, so while I'm not personally involved in all of the programs, I get an overview of all the programs.", "5326": "What is wellness for me? In the past two years... I wouldn't say I was healthy before I got MS, I wasn't healthy. I was always stressed, which probably incited my autoimmune condition at such a young age. For me, health is in the context of disability, but it's about, for me, being able to push myself outdoors. When I was able to push myself across Manhattan from 11th Avenue to my doctor's at 1st Avenue, that was freedom for me and that was a 90 degree day, and I'm very heat intolerant. So I'm happiest when I'm pushing myself outside in my wheelchair. In the past two years, I've joined a virtual gym so that I have a plan for getting stronger and being more independent and reducing my likelihood of developing arthritis and other conditions. I devote a lot of my energy to that.", "5327": "For me, wellbeing means having a plan, moving forward physically and financially and otherwise, and it means have a community, which has been through CIDNY thankfully. I've met incredible people and feel a sense of purpose. And through the gym I've met hundreds of people throughout the world who have the same goal of accepting themselves, but also wanting to make themselves as independent as possible.", "5328": "Thank you. Ramon?", "5329": "Me next? Okay. I failed to mention that I was from Brooklyn, right? I'm from Brooklyn, and originally I grew up in [inaudible 00:15:34], and I see health and wellness past and present. In the past, when I was younger, I ain't think about health or wellness. I'm quite sure, I don't know about anybody else, but in a young age I thought I was invincible. I didn't worry about anything. My parents wasn't one that... I think once we past that teenage years where they stopped taking us to the dentist and to the doctor's appointment and all that stuff, right? When it became up to me to do it, I stopped. But at that age, I was involved with working out, so I loved working out. It wasn't always with weights, it was calisthenics, but I never went to the doctor, so the wellness part, at a younger age I was always involved with... I used to do it on my own. I didn't need no encouragement or anything like that.", "5330": "Then in 1994, when I became disabled, it took a turn. So now, that change of invincibility, I started realizing that I wasn't invincible. When I was laying up in a hospital bed paralyzed, I realized that I wasn't invincible. When I left the hospital, I just made it my business to continue to go to the hospital, which was the health part to me. I continued, up until today, I continue to do the six months check up, the dental appointments and all of that other stuff on the health part.", "5331": "The wellness part, from 30 to about I think 50, I continued to try to work out and it was a little easier, but when age starts taking its courses and little pains start coming from here and there, it kind of slowed me down from working out the way I used to. And this pandemic didn't make it any easier because just sitting home and doing nothing, especially in the beginning. When you start gaining weight, I don't know about you but I gained probably about 5 or 6, 7 maybe, or 10, so the sluggishness of the weight hinders me from pushing the way I used to. Now I got to get a mindset to try to get that back for the wellness part, because the health part, I try to take care of myself.", "5332": "I know that I'm not invincible anymore, so I'm always going to all of my doctor's appointments and specialists that he has me seeing, because at the age of 50, my PCP has me doing colonoscopy and stuff like that. And I don't know about you guys, I grew up in an era that men don't have anybody check back there, and so I don't play that. I don't care where they check. My lack of wanting to take care of myself put me in a wheelchair. I can't imagine what will happen next if I don't take care of myself, so health is really, really, really important and I'm just still working on the wellness part.", "5333": "Thank you, Ramon. Monica?", "5334": "Yes. Okay. For me, health, well, for younger growing up, health was not an issue. I used to walk with crutches, but then as I got older I realized I became slower and tired walking long distances, because in my younger years I used to take the steps to go down to the subway, and I used to be up and down those stairs pretty easily. But then, there came a time when I realized I had difficulty doing that, so I realized I was not as fit as I used to be. But I'm someone who loves to participate in lots of activities, so when I moved here, I decided that I would not allow my mobility to limit my participation in the various activities that I like. So I started using a wheelchair, and that has really helped.", "5335": "In terms of health, well, I've been in fairly good shape until around 2009. As you get older, of course, I realized I had high blood pressure. Of course that worried me a bit, because now there are signs of aging and I have to be on medication permanently. Well, that is still kind of the major issue that I am faced with, trying to keep my blood pressure down. I know that it would help if I lost some weight, but then that's so difficult to be disciplined to do all the exercises that I need to do. So I do a little occasionally, but I am not consistent with that. I still do walk with my crutches now on weekend, but I am really very slow. I don't want to lose the ability just to stand and to walk, so I try to do it. Of course this pandemic is not helping at all, because now that I am stuck at home, I use my crutches much less.", "5336": "When I had to go to work, at least daily I would be standing at intervals. Now I am seated all day, which is really no good. I still try to do... Well, I do things for myself. It's a little bit more taxing to do all your housework now as you get older, because there are pains that you develop as being a post-polio person. I have pains that occur because of overuse of more muscles. For example, I have shoulder pains because we rely on our hands to do so much more. The hand works for the feet as well. If I need to stand, I have to put the pressure on the hands to stand, to get up. So I have pains. Thankfully they are not that bad yet, but I think as I get older, those pains will increase, although I try to take all the vitamins and everything that I can imagine to help to delay that. But still, I know that that's going to be a problem as I get older.", "5337": "I usually go to the doctor for my health checks on six-monthly basis. Sometimes I am tardy with that, I don't go, which the doctor becomes very mad when I don't show up. But I think I should go when I'm not feeling well, and that doesn't happen very often. But the doctor doesn't see it that way, she thinks I should have regular checks. So I have been trying to fit in with that and have my regular visits, but thankfully I don't have any major health issues, per se. Of course my eyes are getting where I'll have to consider probably doing cataract surgery, but other than that, I am in fairly good shape, just need to lose some weight.", "5338": "Thank you, and thank you all for sharing. We're going to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for the health and wellbeing in your community. We want you to think of your community broadly, so whatever that means to you, maybe your neighborhood community, your social community. So when you're responding to questions, if you're speaking about a certain experience related to a particular community, let us know which community that is. So I got a few questions to start us off. This is definitely a good time for some back and forth. If you hear something that you want to respond to, please do. The question that we're going to start with is what in your community is working well to support your health and wellbeing? So what are some of the people, the places or the things that have positively contributed to your or your community's health and wellbeing? If you have a story from your experience that'll help us understand a little bit better, please share. Yulia, if you're ready go to, or anyone can actually go first.", "5339": "Sure. So as I'd mentioned before, I'm part of a virtual gym, so that has been integral for me in being healthier and knowing what exercises to do to help with my entire body. That way I don't have to expend energy going to the gym, and it's especially useful now that gyms are closed and I don't have to risk getting sick. That has made it so handy, and you're able to get personal advice through video chats and sending videos, so that's been integral for me. And also just having that community and not feeling alone beside the fact that I spend, even before COVID, I spent most of my time indoors and have since I was 22.", "5340": "What has been... Telemedicine, virtual visits have been so helpful because you don't have to be checked in person for every appointment. So that's been really important, whether it's for a psychiatrist or for... I just know that from my friends that they've found it very helpful. One had a mild heart attack and was able to consult with a doctor immediately and not put off consultation because of the lockdown. I hope that that remains an option for people even when clinics open, just for those who feel safer talking about things at first at home or those who don't want to spend the energy of going out because it's exhausting leaving, especially in this heat.", "5341": "Agreed. Thank you for sharing that. I think your point about telemedicine, it's interesting how our world has changed and how helpful that really is now. So thank you for sharing that. Yeah, Ramon or Monica, whoever would like to go.", "5342": "I'll go. What works well? Well, where I'm at in Brooklyn, I'm in Williamsburg now, not too far from [inaudible 00:28:02], and I've been everywhere, there's a lot of industry, all the industry, that's been converted, and I know Monica and Yulia mentioned that they use wheelchairs. One of the main things that, in this area, in CIDNY or [inaudible 00:28:27], curb cuts. Don't work [inaudible 00:28:31], not over here in Williamsburg. But CIDNY has attacked it, and the city is working on trying to get every sidewalk in there. So there's a lot of construction going on, but there's many things that has worked well, but there's a lot of progress that still needs to be made.", "5343": "Society doesn't see what barriers individuals with disability has unless they're going through it, and if it's not made aware the barriers that we go through, they won't do anything about it. So that's one of the main things that got me into the advocacy early on, is because the moment I became disabled, and I had no clue as to anything... I can remember when I had no clue as to any type of barriers that any other person with a disability had, because I didn't have a disability. Becoming disabled, and I started firsthand experiencing the barriers that I had, I had to make people aware of... And there's countless, I can't even imagine. In one of our meetings, there's a movie theater over here in Williamsburg. It's a small one, but it was brand new, it was built from the floor up. In one of our all-staff meetings, we come up with trends and stuff like that, and I mentioned that when those developers decided to make a movie theater, they didn't have us in mind, not at all. Even though they can accommodate us, one of the accommodations is that they pull out two seats.", "5344": "So if I was to go in there five minutes late, I'm going to inconvenience those... That was my experience. This is just one story. I inconvenienced the people who were sitting there that got mad at me because I came and paid a ticket to see this movie. What I did was I stopped going there because what am I going to do, close down the whole movie theater? They can accommodate me, that's what they set out to do, but we can't work on most of the time accommodation. We got to work on making the change before build people stuff, like when they first started building that movie theater.", "5345": "Another thing is restaurants. Because it's an industrial area, a lot of these buildings that are converted, they don't put the ramps to go in, they keep the steps. So they have one step, and CIDNY works on with DIA, Disabled in Action, on the One-Step Campaign to get those stores or restaurants to try to get that changed. Those are little steps, and I notice that it's always, since becoming disabled, it's always that we have to push for something instead of it just being a given.", "5346": "I kind of see myself as one of the trailblazers that continue to make awareness to some of these things that people that don't understand what barriers are for people with disabilities. And that's just me in a wheelchair. One example, I'm going to share one story of me and my wife. Good thing you did mention the video doctor's appointments and stuff like that. I can also get some of my records online as well, so that's a good thing that they made accessible for us there. Now when I go back to work, I don't have to take a half a day off just to see my doctor. I don't have to take time off. If I need to see him, I just give him a video call.", "5347": "But one of the barriers that we learn in this pandemic here with my wife, is that because she's hard of hearing, she relies on reading lips, and we are people that are wearing masks all the time. So we went into the pharmacy, and most of these places, especially initially in the beginning, they expect you to wear masks and the people in the back are wearing masks. But when they're talking to her, she don't understand what's going on.", "5348": "We went in there together, and the same issue that I had is that most of these places, I don't know if Monica or Yulia had this experience, but most of the stores or the pharmacy that I went to, they put a barrier in front of the counter. I went to Walgreen's where they had two rows of boxes in front of the counter going all the way down the counter. Now, when they asked for my payment, I can't reach over to pay them and they don't want to come around the counter. That's just the one store. In the gas stations, because I drive, in the gas station when I got to go pump my gas, these people ain't coming out. Most gas stations, if you get their attention they're supposed to... If they see a car that comes up with handicap license plates, they're supposed to come out and service you. I don't get that anymore. That's another thing.", "5349": "So I have to go out of my car, go into the gas station. They have barriers in front of the counter. Almost 95% of the stores that I've gone to have a barrier in front of their counter. That's a barrier. We're not taken into consideration. I wouldn't feel so bad if they said, \"You know what? Don't pay, just take it for free.\" No, but they're still charging me. It's a service. It's a service that I'm paying for. I don't know. If they was to say, \"You know what? It's on me. It's on the house,\" I probably wouldn't feel so bad. But I'm paying for this and I'm inconvenienced. A lot of times I'm inconvenienced I don't feel as aggravated as I used to, because I know that I work in an agency that when issues like that arise, I just put them in the back of my head, and then I present them when we have these meetings like this, because the way we make change is when we bring awareness to it. There's a whole bunch. I could just go on and on, but we're on month four and we're probably going to see some other barriers right now coming up. And every stage that we go through in this pandemic, there's another barrier. That's it.", "5350": "Thank you for sharing. It's funny, I've been to a lot of those places. I've been to that movie theater you spoke of, and it is wildly an inconvenience to you and to everyone that goes there. Let's say it was more than just you that went to that movie theater that day, it wouldn't be enough space to accommodate everyone.", "5351": "Right.", "5352": "So I do like the idea-", "5353": "You see how the layout is, right?", "5354": "Yes, and there's a staircase down.", "5355": "Yep.", "5356": "Yep. Yeah. So I would hope that people are more intentional in these coming days to make things a bit more accessible, and also in light of COVID to keep that in mind, because they're putting all these barriers and things up that protect themselves, but also I would like people to still keep that in mind as well when they're putting up those barriers and protecting themselves. But thank you for sharing. Monica, you want to [crosstalk 00:36:47]?", "5357": "Yeah. Many of the problems that Ramon highlighted, I can identify with. During this COVID era, I have not really gone out to any place at all. I've been at home and not really been to any of the stores. I think I went to one place in my neighborhood, Dollar Store, and I was okay. We had to maintain our social distance. But one of the major problems that we face, that's really accessibility and accommodations. Most times before I go anywhere, as I said, I do go out a lot and practice [inaudible] a lot of various activities. Before I go, I usually do a Google check to look at the place to see how it looks, if it's accessible. If I can't determine from my Google check, I'll call to check if it's accessible, because I've been to places and when I get there, I find that I can't enter, especially places that have a lift from the street to the building. Most times those lifts don't work, or if they do work, the person who knows how it works is not there. So there's no one there to operate it.", "5358": "I've been stuck in the winter. I remember going to an NYU event, and the lift was there but nobody knew how to operate it and I just could not get in, so I had to hang around, try to find a place that I could wait until my ride picks me up, and that's another thing. I travel a lot by Access-A-Ride, and that's a whole problem in and of itself, transportation. Granted, Access-A-Ride is there, available to take you from point A to point B, but then there are so many restrictions there. You have to book your ride in advance, so you can't make any changes to that, and then they're not really very reliable. So sometimes they turn up late, you get to your event late, and of course if you get to a Broadway show late, you have to wait to get inside because once the show has started, you cannot go in. So I have to watch from the lobby, and then when there's intermission or there's a break, then I'll be able to get in. So there are drawbacks to that.", "5359": "Now, one of the things I would love to see, gyms that are accessible, maybe that offers programs for people with disabilities. Maybe if the gym in my neighborhood offered accessible exercises, accommodations for people with disabilities, I would participate in the gym a bit more. So after this call, Yulia, I would like to find out from you about your virtual gym, because I need to become involved with that.", "5360": "Sure.", "5361": "Yes, because I badly need to do some kind of regular exercise. Going to places like parks and so on, that's very good. I enjoy going to the botanical gardens and parks and museums and so on. Now, most of those places are accessible so there is no problem. In terms of going to doctors' offices, that can be somewhat of a challenge. The equipment may not be accessible. For example, weighing. I have not found any way in which my weight can be done without... That's always an estimate. So there's no equipment to give us our true weight.", "5362": "Then, there are some doctors couches that are not accessible. I have been there and was told, \"Unless you can up on the bed on your own, we will not be able to assist you and we won't be able to tend to you. We are not responsible for getting you there.\" That has been really a challenge, where they'll tell you, \"Go get someone to come with you to help you up.\" Luckily, or fortunately, some of them have come to realize that they need to make these places accessible, so my primary care doctor that I go to now, she has a nice, low chair that can adjust. So that is really very helpful. But although the doctors' offices may be accessible in the sense that you can get inside, usually the bathrooms are not accessible. In most cases. And even the waiting room, there is usually no provision made for a space for a wheelchair user. So you always feel as if you are in the way, because people have to try to step around you, to maneuver to get past you. I do wish they would think about people who use wheelchairs and at least leave, if you have 12 chairs, leave us space for, put in 10 and leave enough space that a wheelchair user can easily come in.", "5363": "So these are some of the issues that we face. All in all, I do not allow that to deter me from going, because if I go someplace and realize that it's really inaccessible and there needs to be some changes, this is something I can take back to CIDNY to say, \"We need to consider accommodation for people with disabilities.\" As I watch the sidewalk dining happening right now, each time I see all those chairs being put out and tables being put out on the sidewalk, I wonder, when I get back out there, how will I be able to maneuver on that sidewalk? I can see that problem, that either I'll have to travel on the road, or I don't know, but I think they need to think about accommodation for us, that there needs to be space.", "5364": "Also, in setting up those sidewalk caf\u00e9s, there is never usually any space for somebody who uses a wheelchair. So if I should go there, or any of us should go there, if the seat at the back, that very first one, is not available, then we will not be accommodated at that wheelchair place because it would mean having to ask other people to move. So we would like them to think about us in setting up structures, that we're a part of the society and they should always consider planning with us in mind. Thank you.", "5365": "Thank you.", "5366": "Can I add something?", "5367": "Sure.", "5368": "When seeing a new doctor, I'm usually handed a stack of forms, and I always ask for it to be in large print, and they say, \"Oh, it's not available large print.\" And I'm like, \"I can't be the only person with vision problems.\" Or sometimes they hand me a tablet and it's very hard on my eyes to use a tablet, and you can't expand it. And with those with dexterity issues... But if they just allowed you to fill out forms before you go to the doctor's office, provide it in an accessible format so those who needed translation could use it or to zoom in, or have someone else fill it out for them. But every time, I can't have my aide do that because she can't read and write English, and so my boyfriend has to take a day off work to fill out these forms for me, or someone has to ask me these questions and I have to speak aloud the answers, which can be awkward. And so why can't I do it beforehand? Because most of the stuff, it's not going to change within a couple hours, I could do it beforehand, like my medical history.", "5369": "Great point. Again, thank you all for sharing. The next question is, I know you all touched on this just a little bit so you can definitely expand your thoughts if you would like to, but the question is what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in this pandemic that you'd like other to understand? And again, you can share a story from your experience that'll help us understand that a bit better.", "5370": "Say that again? I'm sorry.", "5371": "All right. To repeat the question, it's what are you learning about your community's wellbeing and resiliency in the pandemic that you would like other to understand?", "5372": "I'll just speak for [inaudible] communities. My physical community, Hell's Kitchen, I'm kind of stunned by the lack of resilience and fortitude of able-bodied individuals who have never faced the challenges that we grew up facing or have faced for awhile. I remember when I first became home bound, I lived in a third-floor walkup that I couldn't leave on my own when I was 28, and I was there for six years. People would always challenge me when I said that I was home bound. And I said, \"No, I meet the Medicare standards for home bound without lie, without funding anything,\" and yet they would still question whether I was home bound. And then the minute the lockdown was announced, everyone was complaining and saying, \"Oh, I'm home bound.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, really? Are you? Interesting. Because the moments that we entered phase one or phase two, suddenly you're not home bound, and yet I was never home bound?\"", "5373": "So I'll say that for my MS community and those with disabilities, I've been so impressed by their ability to deal with these changes. It's very overwhelming and they've had more challenges, and there are more risks, of course, for those with autoimmune conditions and other health conditions. But they've managed it much better because they've had years of practice being isolated and relying on online communications and communities. So that's all.", "5374": "The lack of resilience, I know that the economic community [inaudible 00:49:12], they're losing money and they just want to open. I sit and wonder, thank you, Yulia, because I remember being restricted to the home early on, and the broader population not knowing what that was. Today I try not to. I'm more trying to get out of her, because I got so used to wanting to be out. Part of becoming independent is that I want to be out there more. Safely, but I want to be out there because I've been restricted to the home so long. Even now in the pandemic, I just go in my car. At lunchtime I just go ride around. I don't get out the car, I just need air. I just need to get out to help me when I come back into the house, restricted in the home, I feel a little more better, because I got air.", "5375": "I'm in a community where, I'm quite sure you heard this in the news... I live in a community where it's like the Hasidic population is big, and you think the general population don't look at certain things, the Hasidic population disregard everything altogether. So when the pandemic first hit, they didn't believe it happened, they believed it was a hoax. I'm quite sure you all heard where they was doing [inaudible] and parades and parties. My wife was one of the ones that came out on the New York Times the first day, because right across the street there's a synagogue, and like two or three days right after the stay-at-home order, they had a wedding. Two back-to-back.", "5376": "The first one, it was made known to the news media, and the second one, the next day, right after, it was a big wedding, giant wedding, and the New York Times was out there. We have to speak up because our health was already in jeopardy, and then I'm living in a community who doesn't take it seriously. So forget about the barriers for a moment and think about our safety and wellbeing. I'm constantly arguing with these people that at one time I would wake up and say good morning. Good morning, good night, and their lack of understanding of what the health and wellbeing is to someone else, the lack and the disregard, gave me a little bitterness to them. So I don't say hi and good morning to them as much as I used to, and that's one of the impacts of what it has caused.", "5377": "Sometimes situations and issues, and the stuff that we go through show the ugly sides of things, I'm not going to say people, because people change, but shows the ugly and the evil sides of... What I was going to say earlier was that I sit and wonder sometimes if anything was to happen, we're already in a pandemic and we're the last to be acknowledged. I try to plan that if anything else... This is slowly creeping up on us, but something like the attack on 9/11, I can't imagine living in the vicinity of downtown Manhattan. And I know Yulia lives in Hell's Kitchen, which is a little further away, but I can't imagine those residents, because we have residents that are disabled that live in downtown Manhattan right where the site of 9/11. I couldn't imagine how I would have got out of there if I was living in that area, or something like that happening here.", "5378": "I'm going to be the last to be acknowledged and the last to be assisted. Everybody's running for themselves, and we're not taking into consideration or into account, CIDNY has been involved with a lot of these hurricane preparedness, evacuation process and procedures. When Katrina hit, we assisted when they came over. When Sandy hit, we was inside the shelter system because a lot of our consumers were stranded and affected. A lot of our seniors was in buildings that... They're acknowledged days and weeks later, our seniors. The disabled population.", "5379": "We get the assistance anywhere from a week later, and then all the media start focusing on, \"Hey, wait a minute. We just left these guys behind.\" And it ain't the first time, because we have been left behind for as long as I've been disabled. We have been left behind in every instances and every evacuation proceedings, like hurricanes and the mini blackouts we have. We don't last and we always [inaudible 00:54:59], \"Hey,\" and then the focus is on us after, days later. And then all of this help come later. We're not the first.", "5380": "Now, imagine if something explosive was to happen. These are just subtle stuff that most of the time we're so resilient because we're so used to this that we're already prepared, and so most of the time we know what to do because we're prepared for it. But if something explosive was to happen like that, that we actually had to leave right away, I fear that a lot of us are going to be left behind and succumb to some of the stuff, the neglect that the city shows us.", "5381": "When stuff like that happens... I remember on Sandy, everybody was bucked in and Susan Dooha, which is our executive director, she's running around from shelter to shelter and shelter to shelter and shelter to shelter, and she's keeping us updated because we manned the phone. She was out there and shelter to shelter making sure that when people called, and they called these certain hotlines or they call our offices and she'd get the story, she'd go run over there. And since she's been doing this so long, she comes with the media to make sure that we expose this type of stuff, because it's unfair that we're the last to be acknowledged. Thank you.", "5382": "Thank you.", "5383": "Well we always have that fear of being left behind, always wondering in the event of a fire what would happen to me. I'm always very concerned about that. Anyway, during this pandemic, in my neighborhood I think they observe it a bit more, Ramon, than in yours, because I see less people on the road and people have been quite helpful in a sense. I live in a senior building and I see posted by the elevator the name, a little note saying if you need assistance, need anything, groceries, whatever, call these numbers and someone will come and assist.", "5384": "I have not really called the numbers because I'm a part also of a church community, and people from my church community reach out to me pretty frequently. I've had people who do my shopping, they'll just buy grocery and their core person asks if there's anything I need, and then they'll do the shopping for me and just take it and leave it by the door, and then I'll repay by using Zelle or one of those money apps. But this is how I've been managing.", "5385": "As I said, I don't go out a lot. I just probably venture out on the block a little bit to get some sunshine, but basically people from my church community and friends otherwise have been really very helpful keeping in touch, making sure that I am okay because they know that being restricted like this is not a part of my nature. So they say, \"I'm concerned about you because we know you're always on the go, so we just want to find out how you're coping with this confinement and isolation,\" because they also know that I live alone. So I've been managing to keep myself occupied by just watching virtual things involving a show, doing movies, all kinds of things, because in the beginning, I really was very depressed. Each day when I got up, I just felt as if there was no real purpose to life. But then, I refocused myself and started doing a gratitude journal, and that has really, really helped, because well, the news in and of itself was really very depressing, just seeing so many people dying in such a short time. So all of that really affected me, but when I started focusing on my gratitude journal and just looking for good things all around, it helped to change my mindset.", "5386": "As I said, just relating to people from church, from back home in Jamaica, friends who I have not heard anything from for a very long time called to check up. So that has really helped. I've not been out in the community much as I've said, to interact with people, but when I do go, I find although people are wearing their masks, they'll take time out to say hello. So there is that stronger connection to people, because I think in the spirit of isolation, people want to reach out more to others. So I've found just moving along on the road I always get a hello, which maybe in the past that never used to happen.", "5387": "Thank you. Perfect. And again, thank everybody for sharing. What I'm going to do is a bit of a unique part of our conversation, is I'm going to play a highlight. One second. It's actually from another conversation basically meant to get your thoughts and your insights on what this person is saying. Just kind of pretend they're in the room and they're sharing this with us. So it will just be to ask, just listen closely and then share any responses, insights that you gain from listening to the comments. So I'll share my screen. Can we see this? Can we see the highlight?", "5388": "You may want to read it for Yulia.", "5389": "Yeah, yeah. I'm adjusting that. You can see it on the screen for people that can see it, but I'm going to play it and so you'll be able to hear it as well.", "5390": "Okay. Sorry.", "5391": "No problem.", "5392": "We can see it.", "5393": "Gotcha, all right.", "5394": "The first things that come to mind, just for the sake of time, is just change, a systemic change in the way that we do things from a top-down level, from the big guys up there that make the decisions to the ones that employ the services. Just making sure... There's no question that there is socioeconomic and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels, and that it affects our health. If we can do away with that, where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food and the food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals, across the board that if I'm walking down Corona, my neighborhood, and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan. There's going to be no change, same quality of care there. That's the first thing that pops to my head.", "5395": "I was going to say-", "5396": "Yeah. And that's Maria speaking about her visions for a healthier New York City. Any thoughts or any insights that came from listening to that in any way?", "5397": "Your voice is coming out low. I don't know if it's just me.", "5398": "My voice is coming out low?", "5399": "Yeah, yeah. Okay, now it sounds better.", "5400": "Okay. I'll just speak up. That's fine. So if you heard anything or there's any insights from listening to that. Anyone can go first.", "5401": "Something just jumped out. When she said we should start from the top down, I don't think today, in these times, the top down ain't helpful, because our top, the president, doesn't sound helpful. The top down today, maybe tomorrow, but the top down today doesn't sound helpful. I think it's always been a gradual thing, and I think the policy... If she was trying to say that the policies in place should be where we start from grassroots, from the down up and make sure that the up is able and that all these laws ad practices are in place to make sure that they are insured in times of natural disasters and pandemics and things like that, then yes, where there's laws in place.", "5402": "But to me, after seeing the last four months, the top down doesn't look like a pretty sight. I don't know if you all share the same sentiment, but even now I hear on the radio where our president is looking to cut back funding for testing. That's the top down. Just think about it. That's what jumped out in that little recording. It would be nice, and I think from time to time the top down may look brighter, but right now, the top down doesn't look like a good idea. There is other mechanism in place where we are exposing this stuff, but it shouldn't be that way. I think a part of it that she mentioned towards the end was that it shouldn't be something that we ask for, it should just be something just... It's a given. We take care of everybody and we are included, and we are in the table from the day one that they make these policies and procedures and put them and implement them into practice. We should be considered for day one.", "5403": "I know that a lot of times CIDNY's invited to a lot of events and when... I remember one time, Monica, you know that they was trying to get us into the library. There was one library that we had to go after, and then there was this other library that they were inviting us to give us recommendations, and we had been cited to come in and provide many recommendations because they know that we're the specialists. I think when policies are made, not locally, but on a federal or state level, that agencies like ours should always sit in a round table when they make those decisions. That way from the top down, it looks brighter. Today, doesn't look bright.", "5404": "What stood out to me was the same level of care, whether we're in Brooklyn or at Park Avenue when we go to our doctors. We want to have equipment that's accessible to all of us, and it should be that there's no difference in the way that we're treated, whether we are black or white, so we don't want to see racial lines drawn and we want to make sure that whatever kind of service that we're getting is the same service that's given to everybody, the same level of service, that there's no difference and there is equipment and accommodation provided for us at all levels.", "5405": "I just want to say that I was sick with COVID in March, and so I've been thinking a lot about how healthcare resources are distributed, and it seems like in the current society, they're distributed first to the most able-bodied and those who have the best quality of life as determined by those who are able-bodied, and so quality of life isn't factored in from... It's not that people can't determine their own quality of life, that it's seen through an ableist perspective of, \"Oh, they can walk, they can bathe themselves, they can work,\" as if a person has more value, deserves more of these life-saving treatments if they can earn 80,000, 100,000, 200,000 dollars. That disturbs me deeply, more than being sick, is wondering how society would see me.", "5406": "If they could, from the bottom up, determine a way to distribute resources fairly without this racist, ableist, sexist lens, and classist lens, then that would immediately help my health without doing anything. You don't have to give me any treatment, just knowing that I'm valued in society equally would help the vast majority of Americans and undocumented immigrants, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.", "5407": "Agreed.", "5408": "I want to add to mine. My primary care, their office is accessible from the building going all the way in. I think in May, mid-May, after the first phase I went in there and I did the blood work. They scanned me in the bottom floor, and I went up there and everything is accessible in my doctor's office, but I had a blister that was on my arm, and wasn't going away. He did a video and he gave me a cream, because it was a bacteria, and sometimes I live and learn, that sometimes when you have a lot of health issues and you're taking a lot of antibiotics... I get UTIs, not regularly, but I get them. And so when you're taking a lot of antibiotics and stuff, you get immune to it so they say that I had got, bacteria grows when our body is exposed to a lot of antibiotics.", "5409": "So he sent me to a dermatologist. Now, he knows because he's been with me for awhile, and he makes these calls for me. He said, \"Listen, is this place accessible? Because my guy's in a wheelchair and he's going to go over there and I just want to make sure that when I send him over there to you,\" and you know, I get over there, it's a brownstone. They said, \"Oh sure, we're accessible.\" It's a brownstone and they didn't have a step going down. They had converted the ramp to go in, but you know what a brownstone is, right? Once you go in, that sharp turn... Luckily my chair is small. Monica wouldn't, because I know Monica and her chair, Monica wouldn't have went in there and made that sharp turn like I did, because my wheelchair's small.", "5410": "Then when I get in there, they had these nice tables and everything blocking the entrance that I had to go in. Now, I waited so long that I stood there. Usually I would have just walked out. But I needed the dermatologist to see me and let me know that... And she was the one that told me what it was, it was a bacteria buildup, but they had to pull this big bench that was probably like 36 inches long, and I said, \"You know this place isn't accessible, and we called.\" They said, \"Oh no, we move all of this stuff.\" And they did, but it's just like when I was in that movie theater, I hate people moving around furniture for me. That's not a good feeling, you know?", "5411": "Yeah.", "5412": "If I have a choice to go to one place that's accessible or one place that you're just going to accommodate me, I'd rather go to the place that's accessible. I don't need you moving furniture just to get me in there to receive my service. Another thing is, is that when it came down to the home food preparation, we got a lot of calls, and so one of the things that I did was before CIDNY, we get all of the resources and stuff in the beginning, so what I did, I tried out one of these home delivery calls. A lot of dry stuff came, and I shared the same resources with the same other people and I asked, \"What did they give you? Dry stuff?\" And they said, \"No, man. They gave us,\" and I see fruits and vegetables. Monica was talking about that Red Lion and how... I'm like, \"What did I get dry stuff?\" And when Yulia was talking about maybe there should be one same set of stuff, healthy stuff. I don't need to get all the [inaudible] crackers.", "5413": "Right.", "5414": "And the peanuts. I mean, I was grateful for it, but I was kind of like... Somebody else got bananas and a sandwich and all that, and something other than dry whole grain stuff, which was healthy, but I agree that it should be just one. The city shouldn't just be providing certain nutritional dietary handouts. It should be the same thing all across the board unless you say, \"I have a special diet, and this is what I need. It's kosher,\" or whatever.", "5415": "With regard to the top down, I think it's always better to start at the grassroots level, because in that respect we're able to get to the level where people are affected by certain policies or systems. If we start at the top, they never really know what we at the bottom need. It's usually a general planning, thinking of what's good for you rather than having our input from the very beginning. So it's always better to start from the grassroots level to see where the real problems are and how those problems can be addressed. Not just giving us an overview or a general way of dealing with it.", "5416": "Thank you. Again, powerful stories and thank you for sharing your experiences. The question that was asked, I believe, to the woman that got the reaction is the next question that I'm going to ask all of you as well. That is given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like and what would it feel like? Yeah, again, take your time. This one's a little bit heavier.", "5417": "I'll start by saying that for me, a healthier New York is where individuals say what they need, for whatever reason, and they're not told what they qualify for or can afford, or what resources are available in their community. So start with the person saying, \"This is what I need,\" and then they can say, \"oh, well, we can't do this here, but if we do that we could work around it.\" And instead of saying, \"Oh, this is what you get, and live with it,\" it has to be more person-focused.", "5418": "I'm trying to formulate this into words. New York by itself, because you said how healthy or how would an ideal would look like, feel like and be to me. I remember one time dealing with a consumer that came from another country, and they was telling me the story that going to the government was embarrassing, and so she was an individual with a disability, and she had went to the public assistance agency in the country that she was in. I forgot the country, but she had went, but to them it was like for the general population, it was an embarrassment, but because she was an individual with a disability and the workforce wasn't including her, she wasn't working, she had to.", "5419": "What I got out of that story, they gave it to her, it was no problem. So the public assistance agencies in other places give you what it is just by you saying that you need it. In New York City, you have to fight to get public benefits. That's the shame, that I think we spend more time and money appealing stuff than if they was to just hand it out. Ideal? Hope we didn't have to fight for everything. It's not easy asking for stuff, so when we ask it's kind of humiliating that we have to ask, that we have to ask for the funding, the money, the assistance, when we go on a bus. I started driving a car because in my early years being disabled, the buses used to leave me on the curb. Who the hell does that? What inhumane people leave you stranded? And New York City is known for leaving us stranded, whether it's in the bus on a corner, on the train, on the repair for an elevator, on the HRA lines, and social security, making stuff accessible. What would be ideal, that we didn't even have to fight so hard. That if we asked, that they would understand how humiliating or humbling it is to just ask.", "5420": "That we would prefer that most of us come out of working, that most of us... If you remember, I said that I was in construction, I dealt in construction. I made more money working in construction than I do now, that I accepted my lot in life. I transitioned. But if it wasn't through my resilience and my headstrong pushing hard, that I didn't want it to succumb to just living with public assistance, but it wasn't easy. I had to go and live off of... In 1994, my SSI check was 500 bucks. That was it. And from there to now, SSI just only went $300 in the last 27 years. Here's another thing. The increase in funding from the government when the skyrocketing housing market is higher, one doesn't matches the other. So now we are helping people in housing court. Remember what I said? We help people fight cases, whether it's housing, benefits, SNAP. If y'all know, the appeal process and hiring judges and these appeal, it's more costly than if you was just to actually give people the benefits.", "5421": "I went back to that lady's story, because when she came here and she told me that story, I didn't look at how other countries are as opposed to what we are, how we are. And supposedly we are the richest city in the world, and we have to fight every step of the way, from voting to transportation to healthcare to housing to benefits, we're fighting. Fighting, fighting for emergency preparedness when a natural disaster happened. We've got to fight, fight, fight. The shelter system, fight. The nursing home. You see what's going on right now with the nursing home and these adult homes? I would hate to grow older and not have a place to go or be displaced because my government benefits doesn't matches my rent subsidy. I'm going into a nursing home, and if you guys see, in a nursing home we have a large scale of people, of our consumers, that passed away. What would ideal be? That I didn't have to fight. That our community didn't have to fight. That if we ask, we're just given. Thank you.", "5422": "Yeah. I would like to see a healthcare system where there is healthcare for all, where people are not denied services because of the insurance that they have. They cannot get proper dental services or optical services because their insurance don't pay for it. So you find people are always limited in what they're able to access. I would like to see a New York City that makes provision for healthcare for everyone. Where people do not have to get services in a discriminatory way, where they face some kind of a segregation. Like you can't go to NYU for this service because your insurance is not going to pay for it. You have to go to Kings County. There is that big gap in what you're able to achieve.", "5423": "We have seen over this COVID period where black and brown people have suffered more in this epidemic, this pandemic. So I think it's as a result of the healthcare they have been subjected to and what is available to them. Some of them I think even when they see the early symptoms, because of their lack of insurance, they did not immediately seek medical attention. So it shouldn't be that we have a healthcare system where people are denied services because they cannot afford it.", "5424": "I would like to see a New York City that provides healthcare for all, where people can get the level of services, all people are able to get the level of services that they need. And as Ramon said, it shouldn't have to be where you have to fight for it and have to go through a process of appeal for you to get some item that you may require. People who are covered by Medicaid, you may need a new wheelchair and it's denied. Then you have to go through the whole process of an appeal in order to get that service. So it shouldn't be that way, and I do hope we can get to the point where we have a health system that covers everyone and is not discriminatory.", "5425": "Perfect. Thank you again for sharing. The last question, we invite you to think about this conversation as a way to raise your voice beyond this group. We'd like you to share what's one thing you heard today that you'd like other people to hear? I know that we did a lot today, but if you could just isolate one thing you'd like other people to hear.", "5426": "What Ramon said about how difficult it is to constantly fight for things. It's hard enough to ask, but then to have to fight for it. Even when you know that you clearly qualify, sometimes it's just a bureaucratic error, administrative error where they didn't check off a box, and then you have to fight for it for six months and you know that you're right, and still you... It's like guilty into proven qualified. It's just exhausting.", "5427": "I'm still stuck on... I guess...", "5428": "It's hard to figure out which one is the most important of all the things that we talked about today.", "5429": "I think inclusion. Inclusion means everybody. Not just mean every able body, but everybody. Inclusion. And as a population, we always feel excluded, and they look at us like we're crazy. Like, \"Why are you so mad?\" When I start fighting for some of the stuff, like, \"Why are you so angry?\" Because I don't like being excluded. If I say one word, inclusion. I would love to be included in everything. And in every aspect of our discussion, when it came down to whether it was housing or benefits or public space, voting, I would love to be included. It's hard enough living with a disability, and then having to fight for almost every service that I receive.", "5430": "Yeah.", "5431": "I think that one word is inclusion, love to be included.", "5432": "I think that's one of the main issues for me, as well, seeing the provision of a system where everyone is included, that there are all the necessary accommodations to make us feel a part of that system where we can confidently go to a health facility and know that there is accommodation for me. Knowing that the professionals, the health professionals are aware of people with disabilities and know how to provide for us. There is always a space in the waiting room, and an accessible table that we can go on. So for me, that is very, very important. A system that accommodates everyone and includes everyone, and is affordable to all of us so we can all participate in that system. And a system where all our needs are taken into consideration.", "5433": "Thank you. I believe, unless we have any other thoughts, those are all of the questions that we have for you. If you have any other closing thoughts you'd like to share or general reflections on the conversation, and also do you have any questions for me?", "5434": "One thing that's come up since the pandemic is you're reminded that doctors do not get any training in disability, in how to interact with those with disabilities, how to I guess see things from their perspective. I was talking to a friend who went to Stanford Medical School, and she said you don't learn at the top medical schools in the country. I was discouraged from going to medical school because of my vision, because I was told that I couldn't take pulses. So if they're pushing us away from pursuing medical careers and then they don't even take an effort to understand us, then how are they going to help us?", "5435": "I would also like to say that if there's any offices that are in place to make sure that they are monitoring fairness with the services that we require. Like let's say the mayor's office, they have a mayor's office for people with disability, right? But that's an employee of the mayor, and a lot of times they're bound by, and so the influence of change that that individual in that office could do is probably restricted. So I would love to see offices that are geared like that. That was just an example, but mayor's office of people with disability, where an office like that is set aside and is not hired by someone that is going to prevent them from assisting our population and making those systems change, you know? Because in CIDNY I used to, here's another one, I used to work with the youth program with students who was transitioning with an IEP from the public education system from the age of 14 to 21. They would always say, \"Go to the PTA,\" and the PTA is hired by the principal. So they really couldn't advocate for us because they were afraid to get fired.", "5436": "In any avenue that we go down that has an office that work for people with disability, if they don't fall in with the umbrella of the actual agency, they have to make that change. I think it's set aside separately, because when we're given this avenue to go down, it's not an avenue to go down because they don't work for us, and then, again, we have to go through the courts and appeals and fighting. It's more costly. But thank you.", "5437": "My response is more a question directed back to you, Yule. How soon do you think these conversations will be brought into the system to influence change? And do you really think our conversations that we're having here will have a real impact on changing the system?", "5438": "Two very good questions. When these will be added to the LVN collection for the Department of Health and viewing is today and tomorrow, literally between today and tomorrow, and the Department of Health is committed to review all the conversations that were had between them, the 30 conversations, and use it for policy change is literally what we're going to use the conversations for. So I would hope there would be an expedient, expeditious process to get things involved, but the Department of Health side, I can't speak to that.", "5439": "Yes, I know.", "5440": "But yeah.", "5441": "They're slow.", "5442": "Likewise, I really would hope that, because not only this conversation but there's been so many conversations between the youth with LGBTQ groups, trans organizations, and just there's been so many diverse voices about the topic that you just went. I haven't heard this perspective yet. And I know there's so many more perspectives that we need to hear, but I do hope that this is used to inform policy fast, because I know it's needed, and especially in this time where it was already difficult before COVID. I know that this can be used to ease things for a lot of people.", "5443": "Thank you.", "5444": "I hope that answers a little bit of questions.", "5445": "Yes, thank you.", "5446": "Thank you for asking. All right? So in conclusion, just want to let you know that with the recordings... The thoughts that you just shared will be recorded, transcribed, indexed, and then eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in Local Voices Network. They'll also be shared directly with our partner in the New York City Department of Health. We encourage you to spread the word about Local Voices Network. If you want to convene another group of friends to participate or know of others who would want to participate in a conversation like this, please go to LVN.org or let me know. Thank you so much for joining and sharing your thoughts.", "5447": "Welcome to this conversation of Cortico's Local Voices Network and The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Thank you for agreeing to participate in this conversation. I have begun recording at this time and I need to share a little information with you before we begin our conversation. Following our conversation today, the video recording will be discarded and the audio will become part of the LVN collection. There are three main purposes for this conversation. First, we want to create a new space for community members to listen and learn about each others' lives. Second, we want to connect across groups and build our relationships with one another and third, we want to create a unique listening channel through which we uplift the voices and needs of the community to local candidates, policy makers, and members of the media. [inaudible] and we're inviting to have a different type of conversation.", "5448": "Local Voices Network conversations are focused on sharing our stories from our lived experience, rather than beginning the conversation with our positions on issues. In this conversation you're invited to share stories about your experiences with the health and well-being of your community, rather than sharing any personal health information. This conversation is being recorded, transcribed, and added to a growing collection of similar conversations, and eventually, we'll be able to make the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's written discretion. The goal will eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cortico, the operator of Local Voices Network, to use the recording in accordance with this mission, fostering conversations in communities, and in the media that improve our understanding of one another. The public conversation, [inaudible] may appear in the local newspaper, website, or broadcast on the local radio station, or appear elsewhere including other forms of media, so please only share what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. And if you understand and agree to this, please say, \"I agree.\"", "5449": "I agree.", "5450": "Dustin?", "5451": "I agree.", "5452": "Thank you.", "5453": "I agree.", "5454": "Thank you Marybeth. We want to make sure everyone gets a chance to both share and to learn from others in this conversation, so to support those goals we have a few guidelines for our conversation. They are: Speak for yourself and out of your own experiences, allow others to speak for themselves, share the time and allow others to finish speaking, so take turns. Stay curious and ask honest questions when you want to, pause to take time for reflection if needed, and listen generously. So assume good intentions while recognizing that your words do have impact. And when possible, close all unnecessary programs, applications, notifications, put your phone on silent if you can, and remember to mute out when you aren't speaking. So is everyone on board with these guidelines? Is there anything that you would like to add or change?", "5455": "We're on board.", "5456": "All right, cool. For the ease of this conversation, we're going to use a modified circle process because we aren't in person and we aren't sitting in a physical circle. I am going to give us an order for us to speak in and respond in. This order is just for the beginning and you know if you have something that resonates with you and you feel like you would want to go back and forth or add something to that person's comment, feel free to do so any time. This is just the speaking order for our questions. And you can always pass or ask for us to come back to you if necessary. And so the order I'm just going to go with is going to go Dustin, then Marybeth, then Harriet. Is that good? Is that okay?", "5457": "OK.", "5458": "Perfect. To begin, lets do a quick round of introductions. So share your first name, in addition to your first name please share a little bit of background info about who you are, where you live, and what you do, and a value that's important to you. I'll start. My name is Yule. I am from Brooklyn, New York, born and raised. I work for Local Voices Network doing conversations such as this. I am a community builder and I would say my value is respect because there's so much that goes into that and there's so many ways to having respect for your fellow person. Respect is the value I'm going to go with today. I will pass it to you Dustin.", "5459": "Good morning, thank you for having me. My name is Dustin Jones. I was born in East Middle Long Island, grew up in Queens, currently in the Bronx. I'm a disability rights advocate. I have been since 2013. I'm going to say two of them, it's going to be respect and trust. Those are the two [inaudible] for me.", "5460": "Thank you Dustin, hold on one second. Harriet, do you mind if I mute you from my side because I hear the phone ringing, I couldn't really hear what Dustin said.", "5461": "Oh yeah, it's going to be a hard day today, my phone is going to ring quite often.", "5462": "Oh, okay. What I can do on your turns, I can mute you and un-mute you as well, if that helps.", "5463": "Okay.", "5464": "All right.", "5465": "We'll try that.", "5466": "Okay cool, let me know if that works for you, if not just let me know.", "5467": "Okay.", "5468": "I think I heard most of what you said, Dustin.", "5469": "I'll start again. I said thank you for having me, my name is Dustin Jones, I was born in East Middle Long Island, grew up most of my life in Queens, I am currently in the Bronx, I am a disability rights activist, I have been since 2013. My values, I'm going to piggyback off of you, I'm going to say respect and trust are two good things that resonate with me.", "5470": "Awesome, thank you for sharing. I am going to pass it to you, Marybeth.", "5471": "Hi, my name is Marybeth and I grew up in Springfield, Mass. Went to school in Boston, moved to New York, and I've been here a long time. New normals, I guess, if you will. I had a Pilates and personal training business that expanded into Reiki and Medical Qigong for a long time. Well, just got bit by a bug in 2010 and in 2017 I had brain surgery, and I've learned so much about that and I really want to bridge the gap and help people, and understand what the best effective way is to reach someone, if you will. Not reach them about my point but just be able to hear and let them feel safe. So they can express and I can express. But I love what you said in the beginning. Thanks.", "5472": "Perfect, thank you. Appreciate that. And Harriet, I just un-muted you.", "5473": "Harriet Gershon, and I'm from Forest Hills now, but I was born in Brooklyn and basically raised most of my life in Brooklyn. I migrated down the borough of Queens, and I have MS and I've had it for 53 years, and so I consider myself to be very lucky. After I stopped working, I knew I had to do something. So that's how I became active in working with [inaudible]. They've been very helpful and I'm very grateful to them for many things. I do believe in the trust and consideration, and I'm tolerable of a lot of things going on right now. It's just a very hard time, especially with this virus. Hopefully it's going to end soon, but I don't foresee that it will, and just has to cope with this.", "5474": "Yeah. Thank you all for sharing. Marybeth, you have something to add?", "5475": "Well, I was just going to add to what has already been said was the trust, respect, and tolerance. From West Nile encephalitis I developed epilepsy, intractable. Which is why I had to get surgery. And the surgery that was six to eight weeks, we're here today, and I know that's oversharing. But, just resonated with me from what everybody said. The challenges I've had within trying to get the help that I need. I try to do it myself, because I wanted to be not sick. So I appreciate that, Harriet.", "5476": "Thank you, and I definitely appreciate you sharing. The next thing that I would like to do is share a bit about yourself, and since we'll be talking about health and well-being today, I'd like to invite you to take a minute to think about what health and well-being look and feel like to you. So in that, I'll give you a few questions to think about. So you can think of a time, place, or story where you felt like you were at your best in terms of health and wellness. Some prompts to help you think about that: so what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, what are some of the factors that supported your health and well-being, and how did you feel? So we can definitely take a minute if you need to think about it, and when you're ready...", "5477": "I'm sorry, can you repeat the question? I was having some trouble with my signal.", "5478": "Oh, no problem. Again, we said we're going to advise you to think a little bit about yourself and your health and well-being and what they look and feel like to you. So you can think of a time, place, or story where you felt you were at your best in terms of your health and wellness, and things to note are what can you remember about why you felt you were at your best, what were some of the things that supported your health and wellness, and overall how did you feel? Actually, I'll also put it in chat. So I'll give you a minute to think about it, please do, but Dustin, you can go first when you're ready.", "5479": "Well for me, I think part of my life where I would say I was at my best physical health, I would definitely say it was my high school days. Up until I was about, maybe, 22. I was very active, I've been into body building, I've played almost every type of sport imaginable. Pay for it now in a lot of ways. 32 years old, I've already had 24 surgeries, broken a lot of things, needed a lot of things repaired. So I realized that now, and of course I had an accident in 2011, so I use a wheelchair and I lost part of my left foot. I still try to be as active as possible, I still work out and I still try to body build. But when I think about what I was back then, and then of course now, I'm 32 and that's not old, but when you've been through all of the things I've been through, it's almost like you're 32 but you're almost in your 60s.", "5480": "I feel like I was better then, and I think one of the reasons why is because...a few Sundays ago I decided that I was about 22 again, and I decided to participate in one of the Black Lives Matter protests. And it was something I knew I could do, it was about five miles. I could do this. And I did it in my wheelchair, and by the third mile, I was like, \"Oh, no.\" I was like, \"This is not good.\" I still finished by the grace of the other people motivating me, but it was really hard and a little bit embarrassing for me when I'm like, \"Wow, I'm 32 and just not that long ago I could do all of these things in a heartbeat, and now I'm just barely getting by.\"", "5481": "Thank you for sharing that, Dustin. I hear you, and thank you for participating in that. Marybeth.", "5482": "Well, I also in my high school years was a competitive skier and ran track, and later in my 20s, I actually rode three waves. One was caught on camera, surfing. And I think when I was in my best physical shape was when I felt the best, and I worked in film production and came to New York to be an actress, and thank goodness for everyone I'm not. So I think my best frames of mind were as I moved into fitness, the idea of being healthy, people like me, I had a word-of-mouth business, I worked with some people who I never would've thought, like [inaudible]. So that's my younger self.", "5483": "That's when I felt my best, and West Nile encephalitis, I went out for a run, I was starting to get into spirituality, I had a trip I was supposed to go on, I didn't want to go on, I'll spare you that. And then just, \"Here, Universe. I'm available, barring terrorism and barring no one losing their money on this trip, to not go.\" And then I came back, and two weeks later I woke up in the hospital and I had West Nile encephalitis. And I started, unannounced to me, having some clinical seizures that weren't discovered until 2015. I still maintained a business, and I even had a GoFundMe page. It was unfortunate that I wasn't explained...people advocating for me had exceeded my time frame. And all the meds started making my communication a little awkward. So the times I felt best was when I was effectively able to communicate in a way that allowed me to help people. So, that's that. I think that's probably enough.", "5484": "Thank you, yeah. Thank you. Again, I really appreciate you sharing your story. And Harriet.", "5485": "When I was 25, I was first diagnosed with MS. And I did not know it. My father knew it, chose not to tell me. So I'd always felt that I had had good health. And I still feel like I have good health. In 1986 is when I found out what I had. It didn't even ever enter my mind, and in 1980, my daughter was born, and I still never felt it. I always felt that I could do it and I keep pushing myself. In 1995, that's when I started to progress downhill. And now I use a power chair to get around. The only thing that I'm trying to cope with is needing help. Because that, I still can't conceive that I do need help. Unfortunately, my husband died in 2013. And then I had a fabulous aid who is with me here for 15 years, and unfortunately, she became ill and she has since passed away from the virus. I'm still trying to deal with that. Some days are better than others, and now I need more help than I ever did. I only had one aid, now I have five aids. And I'm trying to get used to that right now. It's not an easy thing. Even though they're all nice, they're all good, but it's still having five aids. Wish it could only be one, but unfortunately, that's not the way it goes. And now I need 24/7. Which that I'm trying to cope with also.", "5486": "I'm sorry, Harriet, when did she die?", "5487": "Excuse me?", "5488": "When did she die?", "5489": "She died this past May.", "5490": "I actually know her personally.", "5491": "I know, I know. And so that's why...", "5492": "No, I'm explaining to everybody else. I actually did not know that.", "5493": "I know. Unfortunately, she contacted some little immune disease last year. And she was in a nursing home rehab, and because of that, is where she contacted the virus. And it didn't take long. And the sad part was she died May 4th, but could not be buried until May 29th. And it had to be done, I assume, that was very hard.", "5494": "Were you able to talk to Roy?", "5495": "Huh?", "5496": "Did you tell Roy?", "5497": "No. The only one that I had told at the time was maybe Ramona, I'm not sure. No, it was Monica. Because Monica and Lourdes had even gone out to the nursing home where she was to visit her. I was going to do it this summer, because she was in Far Rockaway, and that was not easy for me to get to. And the sad part is, and I forget what the autoimmune disease she had, that she was in the trial. And she was at the end of the trial to see if that could've helped her. And the doctor that was doing this trial had given her a lot of hope. When she would come to do a treatment for it, and she would be in the hospital here in Forest Hills, that was the only time I could come and visit her. Because to get to Far Rockaway, it was two buses for me, and it was a big trip. But my weekend aid was going to go with me there. But it was really...but you can tell him. Do you speak to him? Dustin?", "5498": "Yeah, I haven't spoken to him in a while but I'll tell him.", "5499": "If you do, you can pass that on to him. Because he knew her, you all knew her. She was like part of my family. And it's still hard trying to get used to it. I don't think you ever do. It was just like I was reliving my husband when he died. She was so good and she helped with him too. She was my family. And everybody that knew her loved her. And I guess you have to take one step at a time. That's why I can't go to Albany anymore. And that hurts me also.", "5500": "I'm sorry, that's just...", "5501": "I'm sorry, Dustin, to hit that like that.", "5502": "It's all right, it's all right. My uncle was a bus driver for transit, and I know Harriet since 2013. She used to ride his bus everyday. So I'm sorry, it just got real personal because Harriet's like family to me, and I didn't know she passed away.", "5503": "I know.", "5504": "And I had just lost my stepfather April 29th.", "5505": "Oh, I'm sorry.", "5506": "The same thing happened. He was in a nursing home and we couldn't even give him a proper funeral or anything, so.", "5507": "Oh, I understand perfectly. It's so hard when this happened that you can't even say goodbye. I had had a conversation with her. She had called me on a Sunday, and she said she didn't know what was happening to her, and that when she heard my voice, it soothed her, it relaxed her. That was basically the last conversation I ever had with her. And it's so sad what is going on and you can't even say goodbye to your loved ones in the proper way. Life at times, really sucks. Excuse me, but it does. Because the good people this shouldn't happen to. Some of the bad people are still here with us, unfortunately.", "5508": "I don't even know what to say. Firstly, just condolences to you and Dustin both. And again, thank you for sharing that because you didn't have to.", "5509": "But you know what? This is like therapy at the moment. Instead of going to a psychologist, this is good therapy. To get it out and talk about it. Because you have to do that, you can't keep it in.", "5510": "Absolutely. You're among good company, so again I thank you for sharing that. Marybeth, you wanted to add?", "5511": "I just wanted to say that thank you for sharing that. I don't have that same experience, but the loss of someone good that you love, I certainly have had. And not wanting to be sick is challenging, and you keep trying, and you keep trying. What the doctors said and what I read is different than the medical reports. And then for me, not understanding and people around me not understanding, starting to be treated...[inaudible] are co-created.", "5512": "So one time I went to the place I got occupational physical speech therapy, and she said, \"Oh, you come in here like you're coming into a war zone.\" And just my kind of remediation, I thought, \"Come on.\" I mean, I didn't say that. So I can just relate and I want to push you, not that you needed it, but if you ever want to do something. I would've done it myself but I have epilepsy, so I wouldn't want to pull focus by having a spell sometimes in crowds, I don't know what's going to happen all the time. So I wish I could've marched. I've lost people that are close to me, but just so much of what you said, I appreciate.", "5513": "I'm sorry to make this very depressing for everybody. Really, we have to be lifting each other up, not bringing each other down, so I'm apologizing for that right now.", "5514": "I actually feel the, I don't want to say companionship, but the recognition that, \"Wow, I can really understand how this person feels.\" And I feel for you, not because all that happened, I can only imagine how it must [inaudible].", "5515": "I am lucky to be alive right now and talking to you, because I almost died two and a half years ago. So I'm very thankful for my daughter and all my friends and family that I have. And on a happier note, today happens to be my birthday.", "5516": "Oh.", "5517": "Happy birthday.", "5518": "Happy birthday.", "5519": "Thank you. I don't usually even tell anybody. I'm not one that goes around saying it's my birthday. But I got to be better and keep going. Because I'm a very positive person, I'm not negative at all.", "5520": "Well, again, Harriet firstly, again happy birthday. And definitely don't feel like you're pulling the conversation down because this is your personal lived experience and that is what we're talking about. And again, everyone here resonates with you and we're here with you, so again, you're amongst good company. And thank you for being strong enough to share that with us.", "5521": "Will you be doing more conference calls like this?", "5522": "Yes, yes. LVN does these a lot. So I can definitely tune you into more resources, maybe when we have different conversations about different topics. This is the last one that we're going to be having about health and wellness for the time being, but we'll have different conversations about different topics.", "5523": "Do you work out of the New York office?", "5524": "Yes, I work for New York. There's no real physical New York office right now.", "5525": "I know, but basically you're with the New York contingency?", "5526": "Yes, yes. Again, thank you all for sharing and if you do need a moment or anything, feel free to take that. We're going to move on to another question. So we want to move on to conversations about your hopes and concerns for health and well-being in your community. For the purposes of this conversation, we invite you to think of your community broadly. So either about your neighborhood community, or your social community when you respond to questions. If you're speaking about an experience related to a particular community, please share what that community is.", "5527": "And I have a few questions to start us off, but this is also another good time for some back and forth amongst you guys to share your stories, and if you respond to a point that resonates with you [inaudible] being made by others in the group. Be mindful that everyone that wants to do so can. First question is: what in your community is working well to support your health and your well-being? So again, what are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and well-being? And if you can, share a story from your experience that'll help us understand a bit better.", "5528": "Can you repeat that again?", "5529": "Yes I can. It is what in your community is working well to support your health and well-being? What are some of the people, places, or things that have positively contributed to you or your community's health and well-being. If you can, share a story from your experience that'll help us understand this a bit better. And I just dropped the question in the chat as well.", "5530": "Okay.", "5531": "Dustin, I can definitely bounce to you.", "5532": "I can go first.", "5533": "Sorry?", "5534": "I'll go first. I'm sorry, [inaudible] caught me off guard. So when it comes to me and my community, I feel like a lot needs to change when it comes to healthcare. I guess I feel like I know we get ignored when it comes to quality healthcare. And this has been everywhere that I've ever gone, because whether I live down here in the Bronx or when I was in Queens, I almost never went to my neighborhood for healthcare. [inaudible], I had a primary doctor, I was in Queens Village and he was around the corner, and he was good, and other than him, [inaudible] unless it was in Nassau County. And it stayed like that for a while, so many years it stayed like that. Right before I left Queens, I had this horrible notion in my mind that there aren't any good hospitals or any good healthcare systems unless it's in Manhattan.", "5535": "So for the most part, I'm leaving where I am and going to Manhattan, and I feel safer there. I've had situations where I had an accident, and I felt comfortable driving to Manhattan instead of going local just to get checked out because I felt like I couldn't get the same adequate care. I think that's where we need to change. That's like, for example, me saying, \"I'd rather go to Manhattan to go get groceries because there's nothing good in my neighborhood. It shouldn't have to be like that. I should be able to support my local grocery store. I should be able to support my local doctors' offices and my local hospitals and know that I'm going to get the best care possible. I will not go. I mean, I will not go to anywhere unless it's either Mount Sinai or mostly NYU.", "5536": "I remember I had a gym accident in 2014, and I tore my testicle. And I actually sat on an express bus and went all the way to Manhattan just to be seen, and was very uncomfortable. Versus going about a mile away to my local hospital, which I didn't want to go to just so I can get, what I thought, was the proper healthcare. So I feel like we really need to invest in the outer boroughs and make sure that when it comes to healthcare, we all have that feeling where it's like, \"Okay yeah, I may not be in Manhattan, but I feel like I'm going to get Manhattan-type care.\"", "5537": "Thanks, Dustin. Marybeth, would you like to go?", "5538": "Well, as far as my immediate community, the kindness of strangers. I've had several seizures where I've required to go to the hospital. And just going out to get medication and mail thank you notes, and my daily allowance to go outside. And I didn't feel good and hadn't had been for a while, I wasn't anticipating it, and suddenly people were helping me up and I wanted to go home and I went to NewYork-Presbyterian and I didn't want to go because I wasn't afraid of COVID, I just didn't want to take up someone else's space and they were so kind to me. I've had an amazing doctor, unfortunately he doesn't work at Mount Sinai anymore, but he's probably the reason I've gotten through a lot alive, he got me to the right places at the right time.", "5539": "Unfortunately, I didn't have an advocate. I always went in by myself. They decided I had epilepsy and I went through numerous tests and inpatient stays and I think just being scared and not understanding what was happening, and not having control at all probably made me challenging patient, I'm sure they read my file. And then being in Pearl Barlow Memory and Dementia Center, the doctors there at NYU are fantastic. Being at NYU Epilepsy and dealing with Rusk, it's unfortunate, sometimes maybe the doctors don't take into consideration the impact of what's happened to the patient is the only thing that I can think of. Because I do try so hard, and I did well for so long.", "5540": "I got a diagnosis on Friday that made me cry, but it also gave me a little break on myself, so it's too bad it's not uniform and the hospitals don't communicate with each other. So it shouldn't be different in the Bronx. We're all in New York. I'm sorry that you had that experience, I just don't understand that. But I have had some wonderful turned up and people have been great, so I've kind of had both. And the strongest thing would be the advocacy, for people that maybe can't do it for themselves or maybe an understanding from the part of the hospital, like what kind of illness. Mine's so invisible, so they cut out half my brain, I guess. I guess not the half I can talk, unfortunately, for people. So I noticed I don't have a reactivity as much as if how someone approaches me. So I know that that's again that I give co-creation. I really am sorry, but I empathize your story and thank you for sharing that. Wow, that's a lot to take the bus. So I appreciate it.", "5541": "Thank you. Thank you, Marybeth for sharing as well. Harriet.", "5542": "I've been really very, very lucky. Even when we were shut down with the virus, one of the guys that works in my supermarket here even called to find out if I needed anything, and then he would do the shopping and deliver it to me. And I just thought that that was really unbelievable. I've been very, very lucky to have good friends and neighbors who always come and pitch in. One of my friends, as a matter of fact, I didn't have 24/7, and I had only six hours a day of help, and that she always came to make sure at night that I was okay until the next morning.", "5543": "And coming to doctors, most of my doctors are here in Queens. I only have, I think it's only even one or two that are in Manhattan. And I've been lucky when being in the hospital on having good help there. So I, myself, can't complain, but I can understand why Dustin said that about Queens. About going into Manhattan to get the care that you really need. I've just been lucky. And so I consider myself very fortunate in where I am right now of not being able to walk or to do a lot of things for myself. So, my community has really been right there for me. From my synagogue to whatever. They've just been big help.", "5544": "Thank you, Harriet for sharing.", "5545": "If I could say something to piggyback on top of Harriet.", "5546": "Yes.", "5547": "So you definitely have a better experience than I had when I was living in Queens, and then of course me living in the Bronx now. My area in the Bronx is much better than when I was living in Queens. But this is what I was talking about when it comes to better investments. Because the part of Queens that Harriet lives in is a very, very popular well put together neighborhood versus where I grew up in Queens Village and then [crosstalk].", "5548": "You're probably right, Dustin.", "5549": "Yeah, so my neighborhood growing up was more divided, unfortunately. And not well-funded versus somewhere like a Woodhaven or a Forest Hills or a Glen Cove, you know it's not in Queens. So this is why I feel like you shouldn't have to live in a certain part of Queens to get a better healthcare. I feel like everything should be equal across the board.", "5550": "You're right about that. I've just been lucky. Because I've heard some other bad experiences. Even the old Booth Memorial Hospital, I've heard really horrendous stories. I have been lucky, but my daughter doesn't think they're so great, because that's where my husband was diagnosed with cancer, and the way they came out and said it, my daughter will never forget it. She can't stand that hospital. So I understand what you're saying.", "5551": "Yeah, that hospital was a mess. I've almost gotten in trouble there. I almost got arrested there for a situation. That hospital is pure garbage.", "5552": "That's what a lot of people say, absolutely. Absolutely. Somebody I know, he was a person I shared a room with at the hospital. And they diagnosed her mother with bronchitis and she had lung cancer. So, yes. They're not known for their best services. I know. And neither is Forest Hills hospital, which is the old Memorial Hospital. [inaudible] also. But you are 100% right.", "5553": "[inaudible].", "5554": "Well to just tail on to both conversations being shared, I didn't mean to sound negative in my... people in my community, amazing in terms of people who knew me or that recognized me on the street and unfortunately, I moved from a friend's place in '97, and that's the only reason I'm here in a place that's not sustainable for me. I had a GoFundMe page for my brain surgery because I couldn't [inaudible]. And so I feel very blessed in that way. Like I said, my doctor, I still call him. So I definitely agree with you on that.", "5555": "I understand that experience and unfortunately, not everybody can handle a long-term illness when people don't realize it's going to be long-term. So I don't blame people. Both my parents passed, my father when I was in high school and I guess they were protecting me, and my mom passed of Alzheimer's in 2018. And I had to say goodbye on the phone because she won't make it. And I made it, and I was able to be with her and with my family and that was in Massachusetts. The nursing home place she was was good. So I could see that there were places that weren't. I can see a need for a general overhaul. I don't mean it to sound bad, I just meant I can relate to what you guys are saying.", "5556": "[crosstalk]. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, sorry. There's no reason to have, as Dustin said, different kind of healthcare in other parts of New York. And there's no reason for nursing homes, also. How some are good and some aren't. They all should be good wherever you are.", "5557": "Agreed.", "5558": "And because you have a different kind of insurance should not make a difference.", "5559": "Thank you all for your input. The next question we'll ask is what are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand this a little better.", "5560": "That's a good question.", "5561": "Excuse me. I was going to ask what was the question again.", "5562": "That's fine. The question is what are you learning about your community's well-being and resiliency in this pandemic that you would like others to understand? Share a story from your experience that will help us understand.", "5563": "As far as my particular neighborhood in Mott Haven, people have been putting down the Bronx a lot. They're saying that the Bronx, other outer boroughs, they have the worst cases and whatnot. I actually don't know if that's true or not, but I don't even know what the basics of Mott Haven is. But I can say that as far as my neighborhood, I feel like everybody is definitely coming together and everybody's supporting each other in this time. I feel like if anything, my neighborhood bounced back kind of quickly before any other neighborhood. They talk about people who live in the Bronx and they're not wearing a mask and they're not caring about social distancing. And maybe in other parts of the Bronx, that's true. But I feel like in my part, they're taking this very seriously.", "5564": "And everybody is really concerned on wanting to get back because at the end of the day, you got people losing money, you got people losing their businesses. I was actually outside and I don't remember, for some reason, what it was, because I've only been living here for about a year now, in this neighborhood. But I could see someone had lost their business and getting ready to open up something else. This is part of why I'm saying if you have a neighborhood by neighborhood base of testing, and they're doing okay, I feel like we should be allowed to open up and we should be allowed to do certain things as long as the infection rate is not high in our neighborhood versus a whole bunch of other rules that pretty much make no sense to me. That's what I would definitely want people to know, is that we are taking this seriously and we definitely want to be able to live a life like we used to and get over this.", "5565": "Thank you. Marybeth, would you like to share?", "5566": "I think what I learned, I learned a lot about unfortunately this [inaudible] to echo what Dustin said, I agree with everything. And at first, I really appreciated Governor Cuomo, he was the first governor that's ever kind of mentioned mental health, or acknowledging that people are going to have feelings. I grew up Irish Catholic and they still would be whispering \"cancer\" when my father died. But I fortunately escaped to New York and they're wonderful. But I found myself being, I was an epileptic post-surgery and being sort of isolated already from people, I thought, \"Well, what do you mean you're home alone? No one's wanted to get within six feet of me for three years.\" But it also compelled me to think about, well, how can I help someone? I could actually help someone.", "5567": "I can't do a lot of things and I have to have help that's hard to get, but I was inspired to want to do more in a way. Unfortunately I lost my businesses prior to, and the job that I did have was sort of a client-owned directs a [inaudible], so I just had to sit and say hi, and that's gone. But I do think [inaudible] get better and I think there should be more equal-ness in communities, like neighborhoods.", "5568": "It really brought my attention to the importance of the interaction. How do we interact with people? It's so simple. The difference between someone smiling or being neutral to just being kind of \"ugh\" can change your whole day. So it's not about nice, shiny, happy people, it's just about a more of a consciousness that stays with us, about how could I help or why aren't hospitals coming together and saying, \"How come we're not equal? Why aren't we all offering our services?\" That should be embarrassing for the medical community that you're having that kind of experience. I don't want to sound out of turn, it makes me upset to hear that. That's probably not, I guess.", "5569": "[inaudible].", "5570": "That's perfect, thank you. And again, I agree with a lot of what you just said just now. Harriet, I un-muted you just now.", "5571": "Well I agree with what they all have said, but I noticed that when I see people on the street here, that just about everybody has a mask on, which makes me feel really good. My daughter lives in Astoria and it's very opposite there. The younger people that hang out in the bars, they don't even care. They have no feelings about what's going on. And they're the ones that could be bringing it into their homes with their parents. Their aunts, their uncles, whatever. And people are just not taking this very seriously. And the only good thing is New Yorkers have been really very diligent about paying attention, and that's why we're doing as good as anybody else in this country, that's for sure. That's all I have to say. I just agree with everybody.", "5572": "Just so quickly, I swear. Even if you beg me, I'm not going to answer a question. I appreciate what Harriet said, and that's true, and also I see the same here amongst younger people.", "5573": "They're the worst.", "5574": "Maybe they don't understand the depth. My niece came right before we shut down, and I thought, \"Why is she coming here?\" I was afraid for her, she's 21. And so I live in a building that all the young people went somewhere else. But the gentlemen across the hall caught COVID, I was tested for antibodies, I don't have it, I'm going to go back and keep on it. I wear a mask. But I do see the people, younger. One day I wanted to take pictures.", "5575": "My daughter even called 311 and that's not like her to get involved, but she said, \"If people don't start doing it, we're never going to get out of this. We're never going to have our lives again.\"", "5576": "Yeah.", "5577": "Yeah. This is going to be a different part of our conversation where I'm going to actually bring in a highlight from someone else who participated in another conversation on Local Voices Network. So I want you to imagine that this person's in the room with us, and just listen carefully to their comment and then I'll invite you to share any insight and responses that you gain from listening to these comments. I will share my screen. You may not be able to see it but you will be able to hear it. There we go. This is Maria explaining her visions for a healthier New York City, and it actually has a lot to do with the conversation that we're having today as well.", "5578": "The first things that come to mind, just for the sake of time, is a systemic change in the way that we do things. From a top down level, from the big guys up there that make the decisions, to the ones that employ the services, just making sure. There's no question that there is social, economic, and racial disparities amongst our city in many levels and that it affects our health. And if we can do away with that where everyone gets the same quality health, whether it's accessibility to food, and good food in our neighborhoods, whether it's accessibility to primary care doctors, whether it's clinics that have all the equipment, hospitals. Across the board that if I'm walking down Corona, my neighborhood, and I go to the doctor's office, I'm going to get the same level of care as if I go to Park Avenue or Central Park in Manhattan. There's going to be no change, same quality of care there. That's the first thing that pops to my head.", "5579": "And again, the same thing that we've been speaking [inaudible] there as well, so I'd like to get your thoughts and your insights on what she was saying.", "5580": "[inaudible].", "5581": "Sorry, I couldn't hear you for a second.", "5582": "Can you hear me?", "5583": "Yes, I can hear you now.", "5584": "I feel like what she's saying is absolutely true. There is a racial-type situation going on, but it's always been like that. It's always been like that. And this is something where I was trying to get there, but I wasn't trying to say it. On a personal level, I don't believe, I don't see color. I consider myself colorblind. But there are some things that you cannot be blinded to. We're still learning about this COVID situation. And I feel like our elected officials, I figure, Cuomo, one of them, he is pretty much that guinea pig who set that fire and set that tone. Because he came out and as we're still learning about this COVID virus, he's so quick to say, \"Why is it that this is spreading in black and brown communities so quickly versus other communities?\". Well, it's the same answer to the question that's always been there. Because people like you come into office, they promise all these things, and when they come into office, they do the opposite.", "5585": "So there's no secret that when something like this happens, it's going to hit a Harlem harder, it's going to hit a Bronx harder, it's going to hit certain parts of Queens and Brooklyn a lot worse. And I think by him saying that, this is why. Yeah, young people are stupid, I'm young too. But this is why you see a lot of young people in these bars right now. Because why? Because Cuomo said, he made it into this... if you have COVID, you're more than likely going to be living in a poor out-of-borough neighborhood. So then you have a lot of people who are white and they're young, and they're, \"Oh, okay, well I don't need a mask because he just clearly said you're 10 times likely to go into the Bronx and catch it versus over here.\" And then you look at the people who are getting it, once again it's mostly people who are black and brown.", "5586": "It takes away that fear of God in a way. If you're not a minority, you're going to be like, \"I'm safe.\" Versus if you are a minority, you're going to think that it's a completely different story. And this is why I had mentioned earlier, we all mentioned earlier, we need better accessibility to healthcare no matter where you live. Because I shouldn't have to travel out of my borough and go see other doctors and feel like I'm getting the best care possible, and then I come to my home borough and feel like I'm getting garbage. I've already programmed it in my head. I live about a mile away from Lincoln Hospital. And just a little bit over the bridge is Harlem. And Harlem Hospital's horrible, in my opinion. And I don't know nothing about Lincoln, but then in my mind, it's like, \"Okay, but it's not NYU. It's not Mount Sinai.\" I can literally slit my arm by accident right now, and I will refuse to call 911. I will do whatever I can to get into the city quickly and go to NYU or Mount Sinai and feel more comfortable.", "5587": "So we have to watch how we speak, in a way. Especially if you're an elected official. And we need to force these people to invest in our communities. On one last note, too, you're telling people you have to social distance, you got to wear a mask, and if you don't it's going to kill X, Y, and Z. But then you look outside and then the people who are in charge of enforcing the law and protecting me, they don't want to wear it. So then what does that tell you? I've heard some people walking around my neighborhood saying, \"Oh, it's fake.\" I can't say that because I lost my stepfather. It's like, how can you say it's fake? \"Oh, well, because if it's not fake, how do you have men and women who interact with different people every 10 to 15 minutes for 12 hours a day and they're fine, and they're not wearing a mask.", "5588": "I don't know how to word it. It's almost like saying it's only a certain standard of people have to really listen to what it is that they're saying. And then we got this other idiot in Washington, and he thinks he's too cool to wear a mask. These are why the problems are the way they are now.", "5589": "Thanks, Dustin. Marybeth, anything you'd like to add about the clip?", "5590": "Yes, thank you. That's exactly what I've fantasized about being a part of, it's this focus group of source that helps this problem. Problem on a systemic level. And I realized that how I think I'm colorblind, too, and I didn't even realize my boyfriend for many year's family is Jamaican and they were kinder to me than my own family, and we're still very close but I think my illness was hard. So I remember he moved from Toronto and had a successful business, so I asked. He experiences it. I just didn't even think it existed in New York. So I realized how na\u00efve I was, and I stopped a cop. I've been saying \"sorry\" or \"can I help you\" to every person that walks by. The nurses, we used to all cheer for them.", "5591": "I live in the backs of [inaudible]. I asked a cop, \"Well, gee, how do you feel about the defunding?\" And he's like, \"I already made $75 worth of overtime.\" Because it was a march. It was peaceful. And I thought, \"Hmm.\" I said, \"Well how would you feel about getting more...\" I don't know where this comes from. I got a hole here. Because they're not trained that well, in a way. They're trained very well, but perhaps they're not trained for those types of circumstances that require. To be in a focus group that kind of collaborates. I'm not really political, I did appreciate Cuomo. The \"guinea pig\" piece, I think we have a unique opportunity in New York as a guinea pig, if people are paying attention. So if we do or how could it be framed in a way that would, even unconsciously, make people join. Not like a competition, but just to start getting the first steps going.", "5592": "Because I think from being sick, it gets to the point where I have to scream at someone that I have a disability, it's not so effective. I have got this letter, and I was like, \"Can someone [inaudible] me?\" Just to the point that it's systemic and there're different layers to it, and how could it be slipped in. Not slipped in because it's not important, but just some of the other ways that people have said. Things to try to change, like even with the marching. I just agree and I really appreciate being part of this conversation. And even when you're in New York, it's still the rich. You can get not to the experience of any level of anybody, but I've seen even... everybody has to take a part on this end.", "5593": "Thank you all for sharing. Dustin, you want to say something?", "5594": "I think about all of the things that are going on, and I'm only keeping on a New York basis. And you look at what they're doing at City Hall, they're sleeping in the park, and they're saying, \"We're not leaving until you remove a billion dollars,\" I think it is, from the NYPD. From their budget. I am not blind to a lot of things, and I feel like when it comes to New York City... ironically, I'm black, you're black, Mary, you're white, Harriet's white. I feel like New York City is not made for a certain type of people. And what I mean by that is that some people would say, \"Oh, New York is not made for blacks or made for minorities to survive in.\" I think New York is also colorblind to a point.", "5595": "I feel like if you don't live a certain lifestyle, if you don't come from a certain background, you're going to have to come to the agreement you're not going to make it here. For years and years and years, we've had so many things about New York where it's like it's not designed for people like myself. As a disability rights activist, I'm fighting for things on a daily basis that you wouldn't even believe I'm fighting for. It's like asking for a cup of water. And they want to fight you for it. You can't find housing if you're a person with a disability. I live in a building right now where there's 167 units. It was purposely built 167 units. 2% of the apartments have to be put aside for people who are visually impaired. And 5% for people who are physically disabled. And it's not just this building. It's all across the city. So it is designed where we fail and where we move.", "5596": "This is why so many people are living elsewhere and they're going to the South or to the West Coast, which is even horrible. Because I've been to the West Coast, it's even worse. But I feel like nothing is going to change until we get proper leadership where they can say, \"All right, we're not going to sign off on a 99-story building that houses residents where the rent is at $60 million.\" We're not going to sit here and put a little stupid Oculus, or whatever that thing is at the Hudson Yards and make a neighborhood where people like myself can't go to, yet live there. You have homeless people living on the streets and in the subway, and these are things that they've known, and they're just still not doing anything about it.", "5597": "So conversations like this, I feel like it's just going to be a small group of us, whether it be on this call, another call, in the parks, in the streets. These people, they hear us. It's just that they don't give a damn. And until we get that candidate or those group of people, because you know it all starts with the City Council, as well. Until we get those group of people who say we really want to make a change, then they're not going to care. Look at how our bus system, look at how our transportation system is run. Our transportation system is run by a group of people who are, no offense, predominantly white and elderly, who don't even take the damn thing, but then they're telling us what we should pay and what kind of service we can get, but they don't even live in New York. It's the same thing with the cops. We have a bunch of cops who don't know how to patrol the neighborhoods because they're not from here, because they live in Jersey and Pennsylvania, in Westchester, where the demographics fit them.", "5598": "So we need to get to this place where we need to start putting New Yorkers in place of the decision making. Where we can change a lot of these things so that way we don't have to have a conversation as some of these things sound far-fetched because with all due respect, I appreciate what you're doing now with this whole entire conversation, but I'm almost very sure that when you play this for whomever, they're not going to give a damn. It's all about that plan because people are doing this. Like I said, I've been an advocate since 2013.", "5599": "My whole entire career I've done conversations like this. And where we are in 2020, pushing even closer to 2021, and we're still having the same conversations. It's a cycle, that's the whole politics with New York. New Yorkers only care about the rich, and if you don't follow that guideline, no matter what color, what you are, your gender, if you don't follow that guideline, you're going to either get maxed out until you say, \"All right, I give up, I'm leaving,\" or you're going to be a career homeless person living on the streets and the subways for 10 years. That makes no sense.", "5600": "Go ahead, Marybeth.", "5601": "I just agree with everything that you're saying. I got diagnosed with a TBI, finally I got on this TBI waiver program, I rejected it the first time because I didn't understand about the managed trust or Medicaid and I thought, \"I'm going to get better, I'm going to get better.\" And now I suddenly need the services, and I'm getting pushed around at social security and they lose my application, and this happens and that happens unless somebody goes with me, and usually that somebody happens to be a male, gay white male... So that's another nothing that has to do with this, I don't know. I was hopeful to believe that, wow, in New York we have this opportunity.", "5602": "I can't particularly say it, because I think my voice has already been, I just mean personally having a chronic illness that people don't think I should have. \"You look fine.\" Every once in a while I can pull it together, but then days I'm collapsed on the floor because I can't remember where I am. And those buildings, 80/20 housing lottery for allegedly people, like myself, I applied in '97, finally 2017, 11,144 my number got pulled and it was the year I had surgery, I didn't work. They over-anticipated my recovery. I didn't have money, I got past that, but then I couldn't project forward. I paid into the system. I just can't even get basic anything. I got medical records to show deterioration. It's not what I want. I want to help people. I want to do what I love. When I teach Pilates, it's the only time anyone listens to me when I tell them what to do. Reflexology, whatever, however I can help. I've been here longer than I've been anywhere in my life, and unfortunately the dynamics in Massachusetts where I grew up are not so great. And I promise I could even just not talk. I want to be part of the solution.", "5603": "And initially when COVID happened, I wanted to do something grand because so many people helped me with GoFundMe, and this, and people I didn't expect. I never was able to really say thank you because I lost things that did those things. The longer that this continues and the more that I witness the things that you're saying, Dustin, and know people who are experiencing that, what can be done? And a lot of times you'll talk to people and try to start that conversation, they're like, \"Well, you can't do anything about it.\" I totally believe it and I don't experience it to the extent nearly as yourself or other people but I do see it and I'd love to be part of the solution. As much as I'm able to offer when I remember.", "5604": "Thank you.", "5605": "Thank you for having me.", "5606": "Thank you for being a part of this conversation. Just for the sake of time, because I know we're supposed to wrap up at about 11:30, I'm just going to ask one last question, and then we can wrap up. Here's a question for more reflection. Given our conversation today, what would a New York City where everyone can be healthy look like and what would it feel like?", "5607": "A New York where everybody can be equal and healthy, what would it look like? It would look like a New York with equal access. Where you're not competing for everything. Because at this point, this is where we are. We're competing for who has the best housing opportunities, at this point it's no one unless you're rich. Who has better doctors, who has the better jobs? I would like to see a City Hall, I would like to see governor and a mayor, all at the same time, who really care about people who are middle class and low-income.", "5608": "I feel like that's where it's going to start. And it's more people out here than anybody realizes, who qualify under that category. I feel like once the middle class and the lower income start being taken seriously, only then will things start to change. We are making strides, but we're not making them strong enough. There's a lot of things that we could be doing better, and that's just the theme of New York City. But the things that we could be doing better, I would just like to see them happen. The other day I was in the subway for the first time since February. And I noticed they had hand sanitizer, they had a little box with a key and a lock and whatnot. And I'm saying, \"Why are we only now having this in 2020?\" When you look at other places like Japan, and they've been doing the same thing in their subway system years ago. You look at the subway station and it's the cleanest I've ever seen in my life. It doesn't make any sense. And once again, Japan. This is their motto.", "5609": "And this is part of the reason why the COVID got here, in my opinion, as fast and aggressive as it is. Because bottom line, New York is nasty. New York is nasty. We're now only cleaning and sanitizing our transportation systems thoroughly. What the hell were you doing before? I remember in the beginning when they were talking about, \"We're not sterilizing our train cars with bleach.\" What the hell were you using before that? These are the things you're supposed to be doing on a regular basis. We need a cleaner New York, which will then make a healthier New York, and it will be an accessible New York, where everybody can be able to live and breathe and flourish all at the same time, man. It wouldn't matter where you lived.", "5610": "Go ahead, Marybeth.", "5611": "I completely agree. I've taken the subway since I came here and yes. I've had the same thoughts. So given that we're in this time, it feels like a possibility. I didn't realize that Governor Cuomo was... I appreciated him being on and encouraging people to even wear masks, and the fact that they are doing it, I thought, \"Oh, that's something.\" How could we leverage this particular situation to your end? Like to the end of what you're saying in the sense of how to keep people engaged past the time that their families are okay, it's just not affecting their neighborhood. Only people who are careless get it, or however it is. How to keep a program, like for epilepsy, they have Run for Epilepsy, could it be something like that?", "5612": "Or could we use the fact that we're the guinea pigs, \"Let's show you, America.\" And then people join in as part of a competition, but it's really to the good end. I'm probably saying crazy things. Well, they have the marathons in different cities. I don't know, a way that would start to engage people before they're able to think. Because sometimes I feel, from what I've observed, that if you tell people something, they've already made a pre-decision about it, which I don't have to say to you guys. You present in a certain way and forget it. So I'd be curious if there was anything like that, how to start that going. Does that sound odd? I'm tangential a bit and I have a proxy of speech, and that's not an excuse, but sometimes I can come across not as I intend.", "5613": "I understand.", "5614": "Does that seem crazy, though?", "5615": "Yeah, honestly, it doesn't. I think we're all looking for solutions at this time, so nothing sounds completely crazy or far-fetched. I just want to thank you for your input there and your thought process in that way. I'd also just like to, now at this time, let you know that that's pretty much the last question I really have. Are there any general reflections that you'd like to share or any thoughts on the conversation? And if you have any questions for me as well, this is a good time.", "5616": "I would say the same question for you.", "5617": "The what would a New York where everyone can be healthy look like?", "5618": "Yeah.", "5619": "That is a good question. But I definitely wanted to chime in on what you were saying, what you both were saying about it has to serve everyone. It goes back to the point that you were making even before we played the highlight. That New York has to, no matter where you're from or where you are, serve the community and serve it in a way that's a bit equal. You won't have to do the things that you had to do. Because again, in my experiences, I'm right there with you, Dustin. There's been times that I had to take an Uber to a hospital in a different borough or a different part of the city to get the quality of care that I expect or that I know that I need.", "5620": "So a healthy New York would definitely look like restructuring where it's fair no matter you are, you can get to a hospital that's within a mile of you that you know that you're going to get decent care, or you're going to get what you needed, and people that are focused on your needs and aren't just treating you as a general person. Because again, as you know, and I'm sure both of you know, everyone's needs are different. The needs that Dustin needs, or the needs that Marybeth needs aren't necessarily needs that you will need, so making sure that we have access to what serves us is a good place to start.", "5621": "I also want to say, too, I feel like New York, the U.S. particularly, but I feel like New York, since this is where we live, that they have to stop bragging about how legit we are because I wasn't going to say it, because I don't want to start controversy, but it was something I was thinking back when this first happened. And I started looking at the death rates, and I started looking at what was going on in our hospitals, from the suckiest hospitals down to the best ones. And I'm like, \"Oh, my God. This is horrible.\" And what I was going to say is I am so glad that this COVID is a virus, so to speak, versus a horrific terrorist attack. Something nuclear or biological. Because we're prone to thinking that New York City is the greatest city on earth, and we're prone to think that we're the best to ever do it.", "5622": "And when you look at what happened, we were just so under-prepared on a very seriously scary rate. And I could not believe that we would ever get there. I had a friend of mine whose brother might've had a cyst in his bellybutton and he was bleeding, and he was so scared to go to the hospital, he walked around for a couple of days with a Tampax, or whatever it is, in his bellybutton because he was afraid to go to the hospital because he thought that he was going to get the COVID. Now, you shouldn't have to live in a New York like that where something like this happens and you have to do something drastic. From what we're built up to be, we're supposed to be at a point where we're supposed to be able to handle this and handle everybody else on a regular basis.", "5623": "[inaudible] I know de Blasio had said, at one point during this whole thing, \"If you're an EMT and you meet someone on your call who has cardiac arrest, if you can't take care of it on the street, don't bring them to the ER. Call it right there.\" And I'm thinking how unfair is that? Because these guys, God bless them, only have about a handful of equipment that they can do to prolong you till you get to the hospital, and then they have the major stuff. It really makes you wonder the vulnerability about our healthcare system in a more bigger way. How we were just so caught of guard with this and what other things would we do past this storm? How do we rebuild our hospital system into a structure where even if something like this was to ever happen again, we would never be in a situation where we're just so vulnerable. It's scary.", "5624": "Great. Does anybody have anything else? I think we can wrap up here.", "5625": "Again, I agree. My situation was different. I think being by myself, missing the mommy in the wheelchair in an epilepsy center is hard, because I could articulate. I was put in a hospital and they had me on EEG for a week. I went in by myself, I think my boyfriend came once and stayed over, they had me a nice place. But clearly, you could see. I would go out to the hall because they'd forget to bring my lunch, and I'd just be like, \"I'm hungry.\" Not demanding. And I could see them sitting at a desk, I called it Grey's Anatomy. And the only way that I ended, doctor came in and he told me I was irritable, and he's got all these interns behind him.", "5626": "So I guess that happened early on, because the only way I could get any attention is if I went into the bathroom and shut the door, because then they can't see you with the EEG, and that's nothing like what you're saying. And the doctor happened to come in and mention that, \"Oh, we went in there, we didn't get anything.\" Everything. The only reason I got help, it took a year for me to get me help I needed. I should've gone into inpatient. Not because I'm any race, gender, just because I'm a human and the only way that I got attention was... I grew up with three older brothers, Irish, sarcasm thrown back and forth so I guess it could be in my nature. Oh, I guess you got to be richer and the president to be obnoxious and get help around here.", "5627": "And then right away, everything started. And now suddenly, as I'm reading through the records, there were things that could've been shared with me that would've made a difference. I don't have to be where I am today. Which it's probably not evident. I think there needs to be a lot of things that change. And that's lived experience, so real time. Again, it's hard. Governor Cuomo used to say, \"We're home alone together.\" And it's like, \"No, dude. Some of us are just home alone.\" I wrote one comment on his page, and somebody said, \"What rock do you live under?\" And I was like, \"Oh, I don't know. Is that an insult?\"", "5628": "Anyway, I get it but I'm also na\u00efve in a way. Oh, that was the other thing the doctor said. \"Well of course you can't remember anything, you only have half a brain.\" Well, no one told me that when you were going in, you were just taking off a little scar tissue. Just those things, that's how I relate and I don't want to be negative, I'm very lucky. So I want to do something with it. That said, it's resonated with me, I'm sorry. Sorry to carry on, I don't mean to do that. Thank you.", "5629": "Thank you again. Thank you both for sharing your experiences and sharing your personal experiences, as well. So in closing, just a reminder what will happen with the thoughts you just shared. Recordings will be transcribed, indexed, and then eventually shared with journalists, public officials, and participants in the Local Voices Network. They will also be shared directly with our partner in the New York City Department of Health, and we encourage you to spread the word about Local Voices Network. If you want to come meet another group of friends to participate or know of others who want to participate, please go to lvn.org, and thank you so much for being with us today.", "5630": "Where do we go? I'm sorry.", "5631": "Lvn.org.", "5632": "L?", "5633": "Yeah, LVN. As in Local Voices Network.", "5634": "Okay.", "5635": "Thank you.", "5636": "Do you guys have a Twitter page?", "5637": "Yes, and we mostly have an Instagram and a Facebook. I can send you more information too, in a follow-up email.", "5638": "Yeah, because I would love to be in this again.", "5639": "Yeah. I'd even not talk if I was in it again. I'd just sign off.", "5640": "I can also send you guys my email too, so if you'd want to contact me about anything, upcoming events, I'll be happy to assist.", "5641": "Yes. It's being recorded, transcribed and added to a growing collection of similar conversations. Eventually we'll be making the recordings available to journalists, public officials, researchers, and other participants and partners in the project at Cortico's discretion with the goal of eventually making them accessible to the general public. As a participant in this conversation, you're providing consent to Cortico, the operator of the local voices network, to use the recording in accordance with its mission of fostering conversations in communities and the media that improve our understanding of one another.", "5642": "This public conversation and portions of it may appear in local newspapers or websites or broadcast on local radio stations or appear elsewhere, including other forms of media. So please share only what you're comfortable with being heard by the general public. If you understand and agree to this, please say a verbal, I agree.", "5643": "I agree.", "5644": "I agree.", "5645": "I agree.", "5646": "Thank you. We want to make sure that everyone gets a chance to both share and learn from others in this conversation and to support those goals. We have a few guidelines for our conversation. They're also on the materials that we sent to you. So here are the guidelines, speak for yourself and out of your own experiences. Allow others to speak for themselves. Share the time. Allow others to finish speaking. Take turns. Stay curious. Ask honest questions. Pause. Take time for reflection. Listen generously. Assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And when possible close unnecessary programs, applications, and notifications, and put your phone on silent. Is everyone on board with these guidelines, or is there anything else that you'd like to add?", "5647": "Okay. Let's see. We're going to start with some introductions to kick us off. Again, I am with the records of the community project. It is a community based participatory initiative, which are collective stories about the impact of records are activated to envision a more and just NYC. Our partnership with local voices network on these series of conversations is giving us an opportunity to continue to talk about the impact of Rikers Island on our communities and New York city. Bringing in the New York department of health into this, this particular conversation, which is in partnership with the DOH is really focused on a Healthy NYC.", "5648": "And so a lot of the conversation, the questions that we're going to be asking are being really framed around thinking about health and well-being. So to kick us off, we wanted to start by just having everyone introduce themselves. So just please share your name, what you do, where you live, and what your connection to Rikers Island is. And then what's a value that's important to you that you're bringing to this conversation today? And so I'm going to just pop that very long list into the chat so you can see it. But so anyone who wants to start [inaudible 00:03:49]. (silence). Great. Who would like to start us off?", "5649": "I can start. [inaudible 00:04:21]. Okay. My name is Anna [inaudible 00:04:23]. I am a mother of a son that ended up in Rikers Island and ended up staying there for six years, get out with a lot of trauma. And that's my connection to Rikers Island. I was a visitor there for six years every week, every weekend I went there. It was very traumatizing for me too. And also because he was there for six years pretrial, I became involved with the criminal justice reform. I looked for organizations that I could volunteer or help. I didn't know it was a problem prior to my son's incarceration, because he never had any problems with the law. I was completely new to it, to the whole justice system in New York, in the US, and now I know a lot more. At the time, I guess I was a privileged white woman, but I was also an immigrant.", "5650": "I knew the immigrant issues in this country because I went through, even though I did everything correctly, but I know the immigration part and the challenges of uniformed officers, which I think is a general problem here in this country, is the uniform that is the problem. You put it on a person, and the person abuses it. It doesn't matter if it's immigration, corrections or police, people use it to abuse it. And that's what ... I had some experience with immigration, but when I saw what happened on Rikers Island, I saw also not only Rikers Island was a bigger picture because it was also immigration involved in Rikers Island problems.", "5651": "What I bring is a lot of memories from visiting Rikers and from seeing things, not just hearing and meeting people there and meeting other detainees as well. I did visit, I visited other detainees, not just my son. And so I can bring a lot of memories about Rikers, a lot of opinions, definitely because I came up with my opinions now, after all these years of this terrible experience. And also help because I've been involved in reforming the criminal justice system. And so I've been on the close Rikers campaign and I've been also trying to change bills in Albany. I do travel to Albany when it was possible pre COVID to travel.", "5652": "I was on the Free New York campaign to pass bills for speedy trial and discovery. And the whole package that was passed, some of it was passed already. And then we were still fighting because a bill is not going to change much, I have to keep doing it, keep doing it. So I'm very involved and I'm willing to go to travel to Albany if needed. And of course here in New York, city hall, town halls and whatever else is needed to push bills and pretty much close Rikers. That's the main goal, you know your city. I don't hear you [Piper 00:08:14], you're-", "5653": "Thank you Anna.", "5654": "Thank you.", "5655": "Who wants to go next?", "5656": "My name is Virginie. I work at an organization called the International Center for Transitional Justice. I have really, really focused most of my career on how to deal with monstrosity in other countries. I worked a lot before COVID in Gambia, Uganda, Tunisia, other places, while being ... I'm a US citizen, also born of a French mother. For the past five or six years, really wanted to focus more attention on how to do the same type of work here in the United States. And so I connected with Piper a few years ago on a panel and operations, and then stayed in touch in order to be a advisor to the Rikers Island Public Memory Project. So that's my connection.", "5657": "And actually, I no longer live in Brooklyn. I was a Brooklyn resident for 15 years. I just moved to Washington, DC in August, which definitely miss Brooklyn, but it's also exciting to be here, another seat of power, and then seeing with the protests. And this is a unique time. Personally, aside from being an advocate for justice and equal rights, I don't have a personal connection to Rikers Island. But really I'm interested in supporting the movement to close Rikers, to rethink policing prison experience overall. And the value I bring, that's I think a really good question, I like the way that you framed that, harder to answer. I guess I would say for me my work and especially in an areas like this where you don't have direct experience, just I really try and listen and learn and support. So thank you.", "5658": "Thanks [inaudible 00:10:28].", "5659": "I'll go. My name is Kandra Clark, I'm the vice president of policy and strategy with Exodus Transitional Community. We're a preventative reentry and advocacy organization located in East Harlem. We also have sites in Poughkeepsie and Newburgh. Now we have hotels in Queens that we're running, that are emergency homeless shelters, but they're hotels during COVID. And we're also going to be opening up some stuff in Albany. So really exciting, we're kind of been expanding through COVID, we've never closed our doors.", "5660": "I personally am justice impacted. I spent about ... My story's kind of interesting, and growing up obviously I hated it, because I originally come from a village of 850 people in Midwest Illinois. I think the roles of men and women, it's still very traditional out there. I grew up in domestic violence. My mother unfortunately passed away at the age of 46, from cirrhosis. Never met my biological father. And I started getting arrested at 15 for curfew and drugs and drinking and status offenses, that are clear cries that young people are experiencing some type of abuse or trauma or need help. And instead what we do as a country is incarcerate people. And we do that even in the towns of a thousand people, where we didn't even have a police station, right? The police station was actually 30 miles from my town.", "5661": "You can imagine that even if you did need a police officer, if you were a woman being sexually abused or something along those lines, you didn't really have any access to anyone. And it was very different there too. I never heard about ACS or any kind of child system that I could have received help from. I remember my grandma always telling me at 11, \"Oh, just get emancipated.\" And me not even having a clue what any of these things meant. And it was very hush, hush, we don't talk about it. It's a small town. My stepdad unfortunately made a lot of money. And I always joke, my mom lived at ... she actually passed away on the same couch that was 25 years old, because you wouldn't have thought that we had, my stepdad actually made the money that he did. But he had a lot of clout too when it came to the police. Even if the police came, there was really nothing that would ever get done, right? I would still go to jail, even as a young person.", "5662": "I was arrested. I have six felonies, 30 misdemeanors, multiple states, 10 year criminal history from also homelessness, addiction. I lived on the South side of Chicago for three years as a teen when I got kicked out and lived in hotels actually, on the South side and experienced a lot of trauma throughout kind of moving and traveling. I've lived in a lot of places. And I moved out to New York city in 2008, not to do the right thing, I'll admit that. I came out here with people that I originally knew from Chicago that were committing crimes out here, and they asked me to come. And I'd been on my own for so long, I was actually in LA at the time. And I flew out here and we ended up, I got here in 2008, by the end of 2009, we were on a 652 count indictment, 18 co-defendants. I met most of my co-defendants inside. All the women that were my co-defendants, it was the way that ... they kind of jumbled everyone together, right.", "5663": "I didn't even know these people or know that they had anything to do with this. And so I spent four months on Rikers Island. And before going Upstate, and that was in 2010 from January through April of 2010. And then I went Upstate and I served two years in Upstate prison. And so coming home, I had no professional skills. I started as an intern at $10 an hour, literally knowing nothing about non-profits, and have really worked hard to educate myself and get the education I needed in school while also volunteering, putting in the work, I like to say, and really being on the ground. And I kind of got to move through departments. I did employment services for a while. Then I worked in our alternative to incarceration unit. And then I moved into developments and policy advocacy. And now, 10 years later, about 10 years later, I'm vice president. So really exciting.", "5664": "And I'm on quite a few boards and campaigns. I'm a leader with JustLeadership. I actually do consultant work with them at a national level. Really excited to see you international lady on the phone, because that's my goal. I know I advocate out in Amsterdam and I would love to do some international work also. So that's the goal, that's the longterm goal. And with Exodus, I think something that I bring to the table, and I'm so excited that we get to have this conversation tonight about this, because I have kind of been just going crazy back and forth with all the chaos that's going on with COVID and [inaudible] how our city systems were never really designed down. So what my residents and my participants are experiencing right now is magnified by a million.", "5665": "And I think that's kind of the value that I can bring into this conversation is the lived experience. And also the lived experience and how it's translating to me working with the residents. And being able to kind of understand certain things that they're going through, where maybe folks who don't have that lived experience aren't making those connections, right. Really excited, I've done a lot of work with Anna. Anna, I love you. And Piper, I'm a huge fan, I've worked with you quite a few times and really excited. So just really happy to be on this call. Thank you.", "5666": "Thank you Kandra. Great. Moving into the next section, so as I said, the frame of this particular conversation, because this is a part of the DOH does this annual campaign called Healthy NYC. And this I think is probably one of the first times in which we're able to have a conversation that's really specifically documenting the ways that our neighbors on Rikers Island, our neighbors coming home from Rikers Island. Then their needs when it comes to health and wellness. But to kind of establish a little bit of a baseline for ourselves and thinking about what we mean when we think about health and wellness, when it's just kind of start by asking you to think about a moment in your own lives when you felt like you were at your best, right. When you felt like you were your healthiest, when you felt like you were your most well, and what were the factors that really contributed to that?", "5667": "And I'm just going to put an order. And so we can just kind of go in basically the same order that we've already [inaudible 00:17:55]. And so just kind of go around and just like, so a time when you felt like you were at your best, your most healthiest and what were the factors that really contributed to that for you?", "5668": "I have to start, right?", "5669": "Yes.", "5670": "The time that I feel I was at my best physically, mentally, economically, was when I was in my late thirties and forties. And yeah, late thirties and early forties and mid forties, that period. I had two young children. I had a good job. I should add two or three jobs, I never really had one only. I was making good money. Finally my kids were in schools, both good schools. I was eating well, and I was able to buy my own apartment. I was able to save money and put a down payment. I was able to get a loan. And coming from another country, I had no idea what credit meant. I had no idea what the credit card served for. I realized it was actually to put you in debt.", "5671": "I couldn't understand the logic of all of that, but everybody was telling me, \"If you don't get a credit, you can't buy anything here, you need credit.\" And they told me to get a credit card and made debt. I said, \"Wow, I have to actually spend credit money on credit, make a debt, make them believe I had one.\" Okay, I did, I did all that. And then I had a good credit because I would pay my bill right away. And I was able to have my own apartment. I had my kids in school. I had a good job, good jobs, interesting too. I was eating well. I had health insurance because I was able to pay for it. I didn't have it through my jobs, because my jobs is not for it.", "5672": "I also don't believe that jobs should offer you health insurance, or if they do, it's your choice if you want it or not. I didn't understand the mentality of you have to have health insurance on the job. But I had three jobs and I was doing translations. I was working in a law firm as a matter of fact, and I was doing translations on the side. I was doing teaching, so I was making good money. And when you have, and when I say good money, I was never rich or super wealthy. But I was making enough to pay all my bills, to have a good lifestyle and have food, good food, and pay for healthcare for me and my children. And all of that made me healthy, because I was also able to eat and buy good food and even dine out if I wanted to. So that was probably the healthiest and I would say most prosperous and healthiest time of my life. (silence).", "5673": "I think if I examine my early forties, and so you're talking about that time. And I was going to say, for me probably it's around sometime now, since I turned 40. I think trying to pinpoint, I mean like I mentioned, we moved to Washington, DC, in the fall. And my parents live here. My husband's parents live here. Because I think when we first moved, I actually felt a real sense of comfort feeling like I had finally landed at a place where I felt I could be for a long time. Because I love New York, but I'm a little bit more of a nature person, and so I just needed a few more trees and a break to be able to see the sky, my old apartment. I used to look at another building, I used to peek that way to see the sky. I just learned that, well, I'll always go back and visit and there's big place of [inaudible] my heart, that it wasn't quite true to who I was.", "5674": "And making that transition, I also was working from home. I felt fortunate to have a job that allowed me that flexibility. And I also have to eat, to pay for rent, and I also got more time with my kids. So it felt like a slowing down. I think the factors, there's so much those basic needs being met and having the confidence that they'll be met again the next month and the next month. I mean, especially now with the current COVID crisis, realizing how that's ... I still have a job and even as the hours have to be a little bit adjusted because homeschooling and parenting and all that, just realizing how unfortunate that is and how important that is to be able to thrive.", "5675": "Yes. Thank you.", "5676": "When you asked this question, initially I was just thinking how much I'm still struggling with my wellness. And you ladies hit on so many different areas, of kind of those things. And I think for me, I'm manic, I suffer from anxiety as well. Still working on trying to figure out the right meds and right therapies, and I've been doing this shit for, 35, I'm 35, I've been doing this for 30 years.", "5677": "I've been in therapy for as long as I can remember. And it's still a really big struggle. I was just actually having a conversation with one of our directors around, people think that you can put somebody on meds and then it's like, okay, they're fine, right. Or they're supposed to just be fine like that. And it's so frustrating to me, and frustrating for our residents. And I'm seeing it a lot, especially at the hotels for the folks who are being released, about half of the people we have there. And we have close to 250 now, about half of them have serious mental illness, serious substance use. And just seeing also the frustration in their faces, because everyone thinks that. And a lot of it sometimes, not to say anything bad about the city agencies, but sometimes I think it's the city agencies too that are like, \"Here, you're on your meds. Go ahead. You're fine.\" And that does not work.", "5678": "I've been on a thousand different meds. I don't like any of them. It's a struggle to go through the process for them to start to work. And then when it's not the right ones, you got to flip over to another med, and psychiatrists often feel like pill pushers instead of you having a conversation with them, they just want to write scripts all the damn time. And there's, I feel like a lack of synergy sometimes between therapy and psychiatry. And I think it should be more intertwined. I always get nervous because I don't know how anyone could just prescribe me a pill after I just meet you. To me that's just like, you don't even know me. I just get confused.", "5679": "Even through, and I talk about this a lot, me being super successful and I'm super successful, I'm a VP like I said, I run a bunch of campaigns. I make good money. I have my own studio. I have a 17 year old son who is getting ready to go to college in the fall. He is kicking ass and it took us a long time to get back into a relationship after all of the, me being in and out of his life, because I was in jail so much. It took a long time for him to trust me. It took a really long time and a lot of letters and texts and phone calls and him hanging up and him being angry. And me having to understand that he has a right to be angry, and working through all that. So even through all these successful great things that I've done, it is a struggle for me every single day with my mental health, every day.", "5680": "And I still tend to not sleep a lot. And I really get into my manic modes where it's great. I get a lot of stuff done and I can accomplish a lot. Absolutely not probably the best thing for my health. I think in general, what we've seen in Exodus, 90% of our staff are justice impacted as well. We have staff of about 70 right now. And self care is hard for all of us. I think that people who are impacted by the justice system, we either have had to worry so much about taking care of everyone else, our whole life, depending on how a lot of us grew up, and self care is just ... we're fighting the system. We're always worrying about the next person, and not wanting them to go through what we went through on Rikers, that we will work ourselves into the ground. And that's non-profit workers in general, but specifically I think in this re-entry realm with justice impacted folks. I mean, we really work around the clock.", "5681": "I think we have a lot to do around wellness and really talking to the community about it. But I agree with Anna when she said, the first time I could get a loan for my own apartment, building my credit, having my own apartment, having my son be in the position that he's in now, and me being able to be a leader is really important to me too, because I get to empower other folks, and really provide some extension or whatever they need to get them to their highest potential and growth. Those are all very proud moments. And I have all those very proud moments where I feel, those are times where I feel good about myself, which could equate to feeling healthy. But I think from a physical health standpoint, even in my greatest times, I don't think that I've ever probably felt fully well or fully physically, mentally well. Just because I'm still battling all the trauma I've experienced.", "5682": "It's funny with my therapist, I can't even get past my childhood trauma and even talk about Rikers. And I've been doing this for years with them and we're still on all these things, and a lot of things that I didn't even realize were traumatic because it was so normal. So really getting those things to understand those things. And also I think for me too, and I think for a lot of justice impacted people who were on their own from a really early age and I have no living parents either. I think that also plays into I've always had to have a plan A, B, C, D, and E. There's never anybody that's going to be able to bail me out. It's always me trying to figure out kind of everything. And I think that plays into my own personal health and wellness, where community and the lack of family, or lack of people to fall back on.", "5683": "And I do have built such great family that are not blood related. But I wouldn't necessarily ask them for money if I lost my job tomorrow and needed somewhere to move. That's kind of like ... I think for us to really working through that and being able to get to a place where we really feel well and healthy in that, no matter what happens, we're going to be okay I think as a struggle.", "5684": "Thank you, Kandra. Yeah. So much of what you said, I can totally relate to. I mean, as someone with two justice involved parents who have both passed on, and a diagnosis of PTSD since I was 19 and therapy for a very long time, I know exactly how you feel. My therapist said to me yesterday, she said, \"You're doing really great.\" And I was like, \"I don't feel like I am.\" She said, \"You're doing a really great job.\" I'm like, \"Really? Because I don't feel that way. I feel exhausted. I feel like I'm doing too much.\" But so I can totally relate to what you're saying. And I think that being able to have these kinds of conversations through ... we often think about, so what are the sort of practical, very kind of practical and material things that we can do for people who are justice involved, but what gets sacrificed is there's a general sense of wellness and well-being and care and stability, emotionally and mentally, that gets lost I think a lot in this work.", "5685": "Thinking about our community members on Rikers Island, what are the kind of resources that you think are needed to support health and well-being for people returning home from Rikers? And anybody who wants to share can jump in. We don't have to go in any particular order.", "5686": "Anna, do you want to go?", "5687": "Go ahead.", "5688": "What I would really love to see, and it brings me to a story just from last week, with the resonant. I'm talking and I've been helping this woman who has been through trauma her whole life. And she actually shared her story with Rikers Island Public Memory Project. And it was really tough for her. We did a whole bunch of prep beforehand and I knew it was going to be tough for her, but she really wanted to do it. This is all she kept talking about. And I was like, \"Okay, we're going to work through it. We're going to be okay.\"", "5689": "And I've been helping her get into housing and all these other things. And she had texted me last week and it was at night. And from the text, I could tell that she was getting a different impression of why I was helping her. Or just there was some boundaries. It was, \"Oh, you're so beautiful ma.\" It was, I could tell she was kind of getting feelings for me. And I instantly, I called her and I said, I'm talking to her and I said, \"You know why I understand this so well?\" I said, \"Because it took me so long to finally understand this. And this is something that I went through.\"", "5690": "For me, I couldn't understand how people would want to help you or do something for you without wanting something in return. Took me a very long time to learn that. And even, I mean, as I was working, in my career, in the first four years of my career. I really see it now, how much I really thought that anyone who was trying to help me would want something for me. And for women, that's often turned into something that revolves sex. I'm having this conversation with her and I'm letting her know that, I know this is so hard for you to understand, but I want you to look at me now and understand that I don't want anything from you because I'm doing this for you. That just like how I'm doing this, there are other people in this world that do want to help you without taking anything from you.", "5691": "And that as women we tend to, or at least I did and I'll bring it back to me, I tended to a lot of times in my past attached to the first person that would start to help me write and think I was in love with them. And it wasn't love. That's a whole trauma thing that you have to kind of work through and understand that, you don't love that person because they helped you, you might love them in a different way, or they may become your friend, but I don't need to have sex with that person. That was my whole understanding of it.", "5692": "And one thing I think with just health and wellness in general, it's I'm not a licensed social worker and I'm actually going back to school and I have my master's in public policy and administration, but I want to get a master's in social work too and become a licensed social worker, because I think what's most frustrating for me is like, here's a woman who's been in therapy her whole life. And no one has ever brought, and she's probably been displaying these actions the whole time. And no one's ever made that connection. And usually I think there's just such a disconnect sometimes between healthcare workers and trauma, or the reactions of trauma or understanding why people behave in a certain way or respond in a certain way because of trauma.", "5693": "And I'm so thankful that I have this lived experience because I was able to walk her through that and talk with her about that. And now every person that I'm having help her, she's not saying those same things about, right. She's not instantly thinking, oh my God, this could be my next wife. Or this could be my next husband. Or different things like that. She's really thinking, looking at it from a different perspective and trusting, and trust is really hard for us. I actually do the Brene Brown video breathing, it's the seven elements to trust. I cannot tell you how many of my young people, like young, old, doesn't matter age, ethnicity, everyone loves it. And they actually use it. My young people use it back with their parents.", "5694": "And so I did some stuff with her around that too, just some exercises around trust, to get her to start trusting more people also, that can help her that are not going to take something from her. But I think having more open conversations, healthcare workers sometimes I feel like are so disconnected. And it's just like, how can I understand this so easily, boom, two seconds, but I don't have your license, I don't have your education. But the lived experience makes me almost understand it more. And so I don't know what kind of to do with that around, having a credible messenger onsite, we've talked forever around staffing. When we close Rikers, and we have these small borough justice and healing centers is what I want to call them. We want people who are credible messengers with lived experience working on those housing units.", "5695": "And I think for the women specifically, having women with lived experience to be able to run trauma groups with them, run therapy sessions or one-on-ones or whatever. I think that's really important and that's totally missing. And I think it's missing even from the healthcare world. We used to do like doctors, doctors drive me nuts sometimes because of some of the questions that they ask. If you knew my life in the past, you wouldn't be asking, \"Did you engage in risky sexual?\" Well, of course I did. Hello. If you knew anything, I'm telling you my story about my past and I've been in and out of prison and I've been on my own since I was a teen, and I lived in hotels on the South side of Chicago. You can't put two and two together out of all that stuff, that yes, like this.", "5696": "It's a little frustrating, healthcare is honestly frustrating even for me now going to a doctor, just with their lack of real world experience of what it means like to go through trauma, to have a bootleg doctor while you're Upstate, or go to a dentist Upstate and have them pull the wrong teeth. Or get [inaudible] while you're Upstate and still be dealing with it two years after coming home. The horror of what you have to deal with through the healthcare system on the inside, the doctors on the outside have no clue and they don't ask the right questions. I would love to see healthcare bring in more people with lived experience to help guide them in certain things, and also hire more folks with lived experience have us be more engaged in that process.", "5697": "Thank you, Kandra. Yeah, it's almost like when people talk about being culturally responsive, they don't think about what it means to be culturally responsive to people who are formerly incarcerated to people who are coming home from prison. It's like totally other way of thinking about culturally responsiveness, and also being trauma informed as well. Anyone else want to share?", "5698": "I definitely have a lot to say about the health care, the mental care. For example, talking about pills and taking medication. My son was diagnosed for the first time in his life when he landed on Rikers. He was diagnosed mentally ill and sent for evaluation and prescribed in the matter of two weeks medication for his diagnosis. And actually they asked me if there was any such diagnosis in our family, never had any of this stuff. Then he was prescribed two different medication, and I saw his transformation. He became another person, he gained ... He was always a very slim athletic built guy. And I was seeing a fat person in front of me sluggish.", "5699": "Now, the problem is that not only I can't imagine doing a mental evaluation in two weeks come up with such a diagnosis and medication, and then prescribe it indefinitely. Because six years on Rikers, he was supposed to take those pills for the whole duration. And the lawyer's telling us, you need to take them because you're going to mess up your case if you don't take them. The pills were attached to his legal case in court. Can you imagine? It was unbelievable. He took them, but I start seeing side effects, even physical glitches and muscle spasms when I would visit him. He wasn't aware, but I could see these spasms glitches in.", "5700": "And of course I researched it, and that was one of the side effects of this medication. He realized, fortunately, that he was not himself anymore. Somebody, a friend, he met somebody in Rikers that he knew from the outside that kind of helped him get off of this medication on his own. But he couldn't tell anyone that he wasn't taking them anymore. He took them for two years. He was a different person. And he never told me he stopped. I mean, he told me it was very hard, because he told me that they pretty much knew, the system drugged him out. They made him dependent on this medication because he was physically dependent.", "5701": "But he was telling me that mentally his main concern was that he couldn't paint and draw anymore, once he started taking the medication. He was not creative anymore, he was half asleep, drugged out. And that's what made him stop taking it because he said, \"I need to paint. I need to be myself. I don't even have the drive to paint and create art. Something's wrong.\" I said, \"Yes, something is wrong with those pills.\" And I'm so glad he stopped. And I don't even, he told me, \"Mom, it was just like a drug addict. Somebody addicted has to stop the medication. And it's not easy because you want withdrawals, even though you know you don't want it.\"", "5702": "Imagine going through that on Rikers Island, and winning himself out of medication, but still faking, going to the nurse and taking his daily pills and not swallowing them. Everyday, he did that for years. And I'm so glad he did, because to me the medication and the whole mental ... I know healthcare is already bad outside. Can you imagine? I mean, it's not bad. It's that you can't really get it if you don't pay for it. Now imagine on Rikers Island, mental health, two weeks my son was diagnosed for his life. After he stopped taking pills now, what I'm saying is he gets released. The system thinks he's taking the pill, so he's getting released with this prescription.", "5703": "He's went Upstate for two years after he got released. When he went Upstate, he was finally able to tell them, \"I'm not taking any medication.\" For some reason, he didn't have to play the game anymore because now the city is the city, the state is the state. So they were like, they're not on the same page. And he told him, \"I haven't been taking it.\" Nobody got upset about his case because he had already been convicted. He did the two years without taking, continue without medication, but he was being observed and still labeled mentally ill.", "5704": "Now when he got released, he was released into the general population on the street and in this world back home, with the label of a mentally ill person, not taking medication. Now they forced him into programs, even into drug program that didn't concern his case at all. I think that during these years, especially the six years on Rikers plus the other two Upstate, they never even questioned on Rikers Island, do you still need to take the same medication? Maybe you can reduce the dosage. I mean, how can you prescribe medication in January, 2011, and release him in fall 2016 with the same exact medication. That's too many. I mean, I don't think anybody could be taking mentally this kind of farm pharmaceutical stuff for six, seven years, six years and go Upstate and continue according to them without not giving more evaluation to see how his mental state is. If he's really taking the meds, does he really need this? Reduce and change them, you may need to change. No, that's it.", "5705": "They gave him the sentence on his mental illness, as well as the sentence in court. So he had two sentences. And then when he gets released, now that he came back home, he is lucky that he has me and he can stay at home with me. And he has a room because I'm thinking, what about the others? The ones that don't have a place to go. The ones that have to end up in shelters, the ones that have no ... not that I, I am not a professional, so I cannot help him mentally. But I think there should be a manual for people and for relatives or like me. Because speaking to him and seeing his behavior, which isn't, I thought it was a mentally ill behavior, but I realize it's a released person behavior, it's not immorally.", "5706": "I realized that even others have told me the same thing that I met through my activism, that were released. They are all paranoid with crowds. They don't want to go into subway. They're afraid to be packed with people. I was doing the COVID long distancing with my son in my house when he got released a year prior to COVID. He was already telling me not to go behind him. If I walked in the kitchen behind him, he would turn. And I was like, \"It's me. What's going on?\" It's like they don't want anybody close behind. And this I heard it from more than one guy coming out of Rikers Island. I thought, okay, maybe he has it extreme. But I heard other people don't want to be in the subway, don't want to be in crowds. Don't walk up to me in the back, keep a distance.", "5707": "I don't know. There are certain behaviors that I almost thought, okay, maybe we should have a little, because this is not about only mental illness. This is like, you get traumatized, you come out with PTSD, it's prison PTSD. It's like the military has it for war, while the prison has, it's still PTSD but it's for being in prison or jails. So you get a different type of paranoia. People close up to you, people behind you. I don't want to be in a crowded space. He wants to be ... his room is an incredible space after the cell. There are certain behaviors. I know it's him, maybe he has it extreme. But I've heard it from other people also going back home to their moms. And I'd known a 50 year old man back home with his mom. And he's like, \"Oh, my mom is going to kill me. My mom is getting pissed at me.\" And I'm like, \"What are you doing?\"", "5708": "I feel that these people maybe should say, or should ... I'm not saying that they need to have, they're not professional, but we should know what are these traumas that are prison traumas. And to kind of like, I also wish I had a manual or what the symptoms could be of a person that gets released into my home. I know it's my son, but he still spent eight an half, almost nine years in prison, so in jail, in prison. What are the typical type of traumas? Because of course each one is different, but typical things that you can expect or know about so that I know how to deal with them, because I am not a psychiatrist, a psychologist or another professional in any of these fields. And out there, like you say Kandra, I totally agree. There is nothing, there's a disconnect. Even though yes, he's gone through some programs, some completely useless but mandatory.", "5709": "Also I feel that the programs maybe are an extra boost, you have very good programs, but this program sometimes clash with parole, with him having to go to parole, with the parole officers showing up or not answering to the phone. And he has a 7:00 PM curfew for over a year now. These things have to be taken into considerations by people or by professionals, or when you get released back into the world. Yes, there are programs. Some of them are not good at all. At least what I've seen with him. He was forced to go near his house here. He wanted to go elsewhere, no. Some of them useless. And some could be good, or I'm sure there are some good ones, but there should be more of each program. The program shouldn't be disconnected either. It should be more of a program that is similar or to all the other programs in the city.", "5710": "The ones that he went to, they were just so useless and didn't help him at all. But he had to do them and he had to do every day. So they don't, and there is ... Again, the parole officers interferes, give you dates, shows up, or he tells you, \"You have to show up over there.\" Then he cannot even try to go to school and him try to get back by 7:00. So he cannot take later courses. All of this stuff is too much. It's too much to be able to breathe, to feel a little relaxed. Okay, so parole, programs, school, curfew. And then all these other behavioral things, he never gets to ... you should have had ... I think people that come out to the other place where they can let it out and talk, or have people that understand this kind of certain behaviors that are typical of post traumatic stress from prisons, and talk to them and help them.", "5711": "And again, I'm so glad he doesn't take any medication anymore. I mean, he still has these issues, but he tries to ... how do you say, to control them and not let them control him. He's able to do that, and I can tell. But yet I can see all the trauma and all these things going on. But if he can stay out of meds, I would prefer it, because he's more himself. So far the meds that he took, I know that they were not by another doctor, they were prescribed by Rikers Island doctors, but they're still doctors. So why should they be different from other doctors out here? Why should they be able to do a diagnosis in two weeks because they want to rush him back into jail? Because he was in the hospital, in the criminal hospital. Well, in two weeks, they knew everything, rushed him back to jail.", "5712": "Now it's beyond all the medication, doesn't want to have anything to do with medication, but he still has a lot of PTSD. He's got issues. But he's working all alone trying to overcome everything. It's a lot because I'm here and I try not to interfere because I don't know how to intervene to help him. I sit back and I just wait for him to ask for help if he wants help, I don't go at him saying, \"Why you do that? Why did you say that? What does that mean?\"", "5713": "It's like what I'm hearing. And it's like, if we're going to have a Healthy NYC, that there has to be both support for families who have loved ones coming home, and also that there should be support for people who are returning. I feel like too often, programs just completely forget about there's a thousand people coming home from Upstate and from city jails into the city. And they are just as much like residents of this city and needing of support and care as anyone else. And so a Healthy NYC needs to also account for the ways we support people who are returning home from jails and prisons, especially Rikers, and create services, create support groups, create tools like what you talked about in terms of advocate for yourself, to be able to do that. Yeah.", "5714": "But even with Rikers, the diagnosis that they are giving, January, 2011, and the medication is the same all along for six years. They shouldn't do that in jail. Doctors are doctors everywhere. They should really follow the rules.", "5715": "[crosstalk] as a way to punish people. And also as a way to sort of keep them within the system, because we think about jails as like mental health facilities as well, they're the only, right. But that's really problematic, to tie carceration and mental health together in such a way. Kandra, I mean, you're talking to people who are returning home from Rikers on a regular, on a daily basis. As you're talking to folks who are returning home right now, what are you learning about well-being or people who are on Rikers right now? What are you doing about well-being and access to health support? That you think other people should understand and particularly like public officials right now.", "5716": "Definitely, also just real quick to Anna's point. I think as a society and the healthcare system needs to take I think ownership of [inaudible] really be leading this, mental different things. And so regularly folks who have experienced trauma, they try to just pop pills down, you're right. And for trauma, it's not always pills that you need, right? There's this really talk therapy that you need. It's mental health diagnosis that you potentially could need pills. So just as a whole and in the society, I think we need to do a better job and the healthcare system should be leading that conversation.", "5717": "As far as for the residents coming home, my biggest ... And access to the things that our people are supposed to have access to on the inside. If you have serious mental illness, there's legal mandates under the Brad H requirements that you receive therapy and assistance. And also that a 2020 housing application is done for you. I just found this out. And it was just so like, \"Wow, I didn't realize that that was actually legally mandated, because look at all my folks who are home, who have schizophrenia and bipolar, and don't even, have never heard about the 2020 application. Housing is so-", "5718": "What is that? I don't know what it is either.", "5719": "I know, most people ... it's a housing application for folks who have serious mental illness. There's also a 2010 app that can be for serious substance use, and it can help ... you still get put on a waiting list. You're still probably going to be waiting a year, but you can get your own scatter site apartment at the end of the day. That you'll be on a waiting list for it. And it's your own apartment, it's your own unit. It's not a dorm. It's not a shelter. It's not I have three roommates that I hate and I have to deal with every day.", "5720": "It's like a goal for participants to get to there. You might have to go through two years of hell in whatever housing situation you have until your name pops up on that waiting list. But we should be starting those as early as possible since we know that they have waiting lists. And I think my biggest thing seen with the residents, the residents are so concerned about housing, and it impacts their health in every form of facet and way, right. They're out, I have some residents who have called and have been using drugs, be all worried that when these hotels close, that they are going to be back out on the streets.", "5721": "I think any conversation that we talk around health, also housing plays a huge role in it. And we all just said that, right. Anna, you talked about how getting that loan and getting your own apartment. And it was the same thing for me. Those are some of the greatest moments of my life, was being able to do those things. So healthy, those are the things that made me feel the most healthy, right. I think housing as a city, we need to do better. And the city systems, all of them, right, we need an integrated system that all of us use and know. And what [inaudible] is doing, and HRA, and DHS, it shouldn't be, although we could better integrate care too. I know a lot of my residents are tired of going to 50 places to get stuff, right.", "5722": "We try to also find the folks, the programs that can do their mental health, physical health and behavioral health. And so it's all three of them, but then some of those programs, and especially if they're a larger part of the healthcare system, right? Like a lot of those, even if they're non-profits, they're very health oriented. A lot of them don't have a lot of folks with lived experience working there. And prime example, I get a call today actually, and it blew my mind. But I had a provider telling me that one of the residents that I had got into a specific housing was getting ready to get discharged because they were being verbally abusive.", "5723": "And I'm thinking to myself, \"Okay.\" A, I get it, nobody should be verbally abused. I get it. But if from my perspective I'm like, I'm expecting, because this is supposed to be a crisis that somebody got stabbed or something, because that's ... I'm thinking, oh my God, it's a serious thing. You're interrupting what I'm doing. It's got to be some serious thing. And then to hear that it was just around verbal abuse. I was like, \"Okay.\" I think we all need to do a little bit better too about understanding exactly what Anna said, institutionalization. And I still don't like people walking up behind me and I'm not a black man, but guess what? I don't like people walking up behind me and I instantly react right and tense up. And all of those same behaviors that I had in prison, 10 years after coming home, those are still innate behaviors for me.", "5724": "And I know a lot of folks that I work with who did 20 and 30 years, those are kind of things that stick with them their whole lives, right? It's not something when we talk about trauma that you can turn off after a two months session, right. I think for me, I always say, I'll be in therapy for the rest of my life. I can't ever see that I'll ever fully overcome all the trauma [inaudible 01:00:40]. I just can't see that point right now. Hopefully there is that point in the future. But I think just doing better about integrating the healthcare systems, making sure that the providers just like Anna said, the providers that are provided the funding to do this work, we hold them accountable also, that they are culturally responsive, that they do truly understand the justice system. And coming up with new ways to do that I think is really going to benefit our residents in a long time.", "5725": "And these are the things that we're hearing every day from them, they're crying out for help. Another thing that really gets me too is, and maybe it's just because we're Exodus, so we always take people back. We don't turn anybody away because of your crime, all of us are just as impacted. We see everyone as truly equal. There's no one that no matter how serious or harmful of a crime you had that I feel [inaudible 01:01:44], right? We all work together and we all have this coalition.", "5726": "And I just wish that more providers would also kind of embrace some of those values. I get a lot of times where providers are, oh, no, I can't take that person, because she was just in my program a year ago and she didn't do good. Well, that was a year ago. My residents are now crying out saying, \"I want help now.\" Maybe she was forced in to help a year ago through a court system and she wasn't ready. But don't think because she didn't get it the first time that she might not get it the second time. And I think even from the healthcare standpoint or even the provider standpoint, sometimes we give up on people way too damn quick.", "5727": "And if you really want to understand justice [inaudible 01:02:34]. People always say, \"If you want to see me at 16. Oh my God, I would have got kicked out of everything. I always used to tell my old program that I worked for, I was like, \"I wouldn't have lasted in this program for three months. Y'all would've threw me out, because I was really angry, I was violent. I had a lot of anger in me, and I was very difficult to work with.\" And that's what I experienced a lot in my life, was therapists giving up on me, programs throwing me out. I got kicked out of school, everyone gave up. And I just look at myself now and I'm like, \"Damn, I wonder what would have happened if just one of those people wouldn't have gave up on me during that life.\"", "5728": "And I think of that when I work with the residents, like we will never give up on you. If you make mistakes 10 times, guess what? We're going to help you pick your ass back up on the [inaudible] the health care system in general was more residential program, two years ago or a year ago, oh, I can't take that person back. I think that's bullshit. I think that our health care system and that's non-profits and city agencies can do a hell of a lot better than pushing people aside because they had difficulties with them in the past. Understanding that, yeah, we have a lot of anger and trauma.", "5729": "And I used to always have this problem with quote unquote being too blunt. Now for me, I'm just like, \"Why do we have to tip toe around everything? Why can't we just be real? I don't understand why everything has to go in circles.\" And it took me a long time to become professional quote unquote, because I wasn't so blunt with everyone. But getting people to understand that like, it didn't make me a bad person or a person that people should have not worked with because I was blunt. Maybe society needs to get a little bit more blunt and stop tiptoeing around. I think flipping it around sometimes. And I hear that a lot from my residents. Or even with nursing staff and things like that, which a lot of them do not like the city nursing staff. They say that a lot, I wish she would have just came at me like this and it would have been fine. If she would've just said it like this. Why didn't she use humanizing language?", "5730": "I can't tell you how many healthcare providers or healthcare workers said, \"Oh, you're ex offender. Oh, you're a prisoner. Oh, you're ex-convict.\" I get that, and I have white skin and I've been out for 10 years. If I get that, I can only imagine how, especially a young black man who's going in there would be treated by a healthcare professional. I think there's a lot that our healthcare professionals can learn from the people that they're serving. And that's what I'd really suggest is that they start doing some focus groups. If you're a healthcare provider or a huge hospital, or a provider that's serving a lot of folks coming home from jail and prison, then you need to start having some conversations with us. And you all need to start changing your policies a little bit more to reflect what's going to work, because we're the population you're working with, right?", "5731": "Thank you. I'm sorry [inaudible 01:05:50], did you want to add anything?", "5732": "Thank you. I'll just jump in just to reinforce everything that you all have been saying about the mental health system. So while my family is not just as affected, definitely mentally health impacted. My sister had serious mental health issues and committed suicide 10 years ago, 11 years ago. And she had like a psychotic break in New York city where she was hospitalized for two weeks. And then they said she was fine. And the option was either go to this like day treatment program for substance abuse. And people really had a cognitive level that was much different than my sister's.", "5733": "She was high functioning when she was doing well, but not when she wasn't, that will go live with my parents. And so she came with my parents, which at 30 was not the right solution. Also some of the medications that they gave were known to have suicidal ideation as a side effect. And my mother's psychologist, so she had all the supports that we could imagine, and it wasn't enough to help her. And I think this black and white, you're either so severely ill that you have to be hospitalized or there's substance abuse programs, or we're just going to park you somewhere in front of a computer for a day. There's not like pushing [inaudible] to live on her own, but have support, have the autonomy, but not be left isolated in New York city, and that we didn't find that to exist. I think just thinking about Healthy NYC, I mean, I think mental health in general needs to be revisited and nuanced as you've all said. And I can imagine that's only more significant for those who are coming out. So yeah, I think just definitely to echo more holistic and responsive care.", "5734": "Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. I think, the year after I came out of the mental health hospital that I was in, it was like a lack facility and I came out and I had no housing, and I was far away from family. I will say that was probably the most dangerous year of my life, right. I think the other thing that I think about, particularly for young people and particularly for young girls of color, is that without these kinds of supports that we're talking about, that we become extremely vulnerable, right? Without access to proper mental health support, without access to healthcare, without access to housing, without access to employment and a support system, it's the most dangerous time in your life. And you're susceptible to lots of different things.", "5735": "And so when systems that are put in place to support us fail us in a big way, it only exacerbates these things. It makes it harder to heal and recover and be well. And so all of what y'all were saying I think becomes even more important. We think about folks who don't have family members that they can go and stay with, right? Who are solely dependent on the help of whoever is available, whoever has a couch that they can sleep on. And so that's the other thing I think when you talk about sort of integrated systems, and healthcare providers who're thinking about this in a much more intersectional way. I think that becomes really key when it comes to the most vulnerable and the most marginalized. Given our conversation and all that we're talking about, what would a Healthy NYC look like? Including for people who are detained or returning home from Rikers, what would a Healthy NYC look like for them?", "5736": "So access ... Oh, sorry.", "5737": "Yeah, go ahead.", "5738": "Just access to culturally responsive and Trauma informed providers, and a way to hold systems and providers accountable also. I think that is part of being healthy is knowing that if there is something that's done, that's wrong, that you have the avenue to appeal to whatever, right. That there's some accountability measure and that you have access to enforce that accountability. And that's something I think justice impacted people for a long time. And this might be part of the reason why the healthcare system hasn't changed compared to so many other systems that are in the process at least with changing, is we're so happy to just have any kind of like ... At my worst, I was just happy to have a couch to sleep on or a floor to sleep on somewhere. And so we get used to expecting, and this kind of goes back to self care, we don't get used to expecting a lot.", "5739": "And I think that can kind of play into us not really understanding fully how healthy we could become because we don't have access to those things. And I think also a Healthy NYC will, also the stigma that's tied with mental health and substance use and even trauma, right. And I mean, just the stigma alone, that's tied with serious mental illness. It's so frustrating to me when I talk about my mental illness with folks that it's so flabbergasting to them because I'm so successful in my life. To them, they equate serious mental illness with not being able to be successful, not being able to be employed, not being able to function. And yes, there's all different levels of folks, right? So there might be some folks who need that extra support in order to actually function in their daily life. But nine out of the 10 people I've met with serious mental illness, and I think it's even probably a little bit higher, can absolutely function, can absolutely get jobs.", "5740": "They need the support wrapped around them and they need society to stop being so discriminatory and just so negative about mental health. But it's so always eye-opening to me to see the untapped potential in people and how society because they are schizophrenia or because they have bipolar with psychotic episodes. They just absolutely think that folks with those diagnosis can just not do anything in this world. And we almost set them up to stay in that we do, we set them up to stay in this low poverty level, and not being able to ever get out and break the cycle of crime because we actually kind of keep them there, because we less than their value or put ... we automatically, instead of looking at them from a strength based perspective, we're looking at them from such a negative viewpoint.", "5741": "And I actually talked to my boss a lot around, my mania can actually be very strength based because I can accomplish so much. Yes, there's the negative aspect to it, that I'm not as good with self care and need to really focus on my health also. But I can usually accomplish more than most of the general population because a lot of people were manic. Steve jobs was manic, dammit. It's I think getting folks to understand and see that like, just because we have a mental health diagnosis does not mean we're illiterate or incompetent or unable to understand. I hate when doctors talk to me like I'm in kindergarten. Turn the computer on, like you can have IT departments talk to you. But I feel like they were doctors sometimes, it's like some of the questions they ask, I'm like, \"Am I in kindergarten? I'm not five years old. Treat us like we're human beings too. Just because we have a mental health diagnosis, that doesn't mean that we're dyslexic or illiterate.\"", "5742": "There's just so many things, I think there's so much judgment on folks, and there's so much misinformation and lack of education and just plain ignorance, especially with the healthcare field, that we have a lot more work to do in this society. And a true Healthy NYC I think breaks down all of those barriers. It really empowers people. We really look at the strengths that folks have and then help them get into opportunities that they need, so they can actually get those careers and not just stay in minimum wage jobs, right. And all of that, I think employment is very tied to your health and wellness also. And if we really want to talk about this integrated holistic system, Piper, employment has got to be tied to that too with housing.", "5743": "Understanding that there might be limitations for certain folks on certain things, but that doesn't mean that there's absolutely nothing that they can do or that they're completely limited, right. It's really being innovative and creative and figuring out, I had one of the residents at the hotel. And one thing I also just want to mention too, when I was doing those 18 interviews, the last couple of weeks. At least four of them talked about how they witnessed someone commit suicide on Rikers or Upstate and how they had to help get the person off of whatever they were hanging from. And that the officers would either make fun of the [inaudible 01:15:52], because they had to help with the body. Or they would make fun of those weak, you get in there and you, help get this person down. And it was so just blow.", "5744": "And this is a constant, right? We've known this on John McKenzie. We've known this for so long that this is going on in prisons. But all of them said the same thing. There was no therapy afterwards. There was no, \"Hey, how are you? Are you okay that you just had to do this?\" Mind you, it should be illegal that they should be having them do that in the first place, right. So that should not be a requirement of you as an incarcerated person that you have to help touch dead bodies, right. And I think just think through, after hearing those stories, it was all guys too that I was talking to, and I talked to all of them because to them this was normal. And I remember, right, I mean we've all, if you've been incarcerated, this is normal. But it's getting them to understand that it should not be normal. That should not be what we stand for, that should not be.", "5745": "And I would love to see the healthcare system actually learn and know the stats of the abuse that's going on inside of how many times, and outside, we would never accept this in society. But how it's just a normal everyday thing while you're incarcerated. And I guarantee you doctors have no effin clue about what really goes on inside. And I think them just asking the questions and opening up, like I said before, those focus groups. I think if we could get the healthcare to actually, a healthcare system to actually understand, that's a whole new advocacy platform, right. That can kind of join us in this fight. And I think that a lot of them are educated and probably do have the best intentions at heart. So giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, it would be great to start having these conversations with them, and really getting the healthcare system to fully understand all the trauma that people experienced before, during, and after incarceration. Because it's not just the during, it's always before and after also. And really getting them to see it from ...", "5746": "Thank you, Kandra.", "5747": "Can I jump in real quick on that please?", "5748": "Please,", "5749": "I think, and imagine a Healthy NYC, especially now when we're also talking about defunding the police or reforming the police. A lot of conversations around that have been noting that oftentimes will call 911 when there's a mental health issue. And someone shows up with a gun and maybe two hours of training on de-escalation, that's not the right response, right. And the number of mentally ill people who get killed by police because they're in crisis, they're harmless, but they're in crisis. And seeing that, like my sister, the cops who came to get her when she was having a break and how traumatizing that is.", "5750": "And just wishing that riding this wave of attention and energy around what's broken with so much of our country and systems. Thinking about from the health perspective, is there a way to get a dedicated number or if 911 can handle calls to mental health professionals to kind of separate out the role of police and mental health, and really elevate the role that mental health professionals should play in our society as crisis respondents. I think we've seen someone down on the subway with hotlines, or I remember seeing that about a year ago, different announcements about if you have a hard time talk to someone or call somebody in a number. I don't know how effective that's been, but I think to the points that you raised about the stigma around mental health and still that we just conflate criminal justice and mental health, when they really need to be separated.", "5751": "That's a really great point. I know that DOH does ... there is a sort of a basic mental health training that community members can do. There's also trainings on addressing, dealing with overdose. But what you're saying is so important in terms of like just elevating the role of mental health professionals, healthcare professionals, but also everyday residents to have the skills and the training that if your next door neighbor is in crisis, that you know how to respond to that and that you don't feel so powerless that your only option is to not dial 911 and call the police.", "5752": "Everyone should be able to feel like, okay, if my next door neighbor is in crisis, I know what to do. Or several neighbors know what to do, because calling the cops means people could lose their lives. But I think people don't feel like they have the skills to be able to do that and be able to do that well, so that's a really good point. As we get ready to close out, because we're almost at time. I just want to see if you all had, if there was one thing that you wanted local representatives to know right now, something that you think is important for them to be thinking about as we ... if we're going to cultivate a Healthy NYC, what would be that thing? What would you want to tell them? Yeah, Anna.", "5753": "Since we're talking about Healthy NYC, especially transitioning back. I am completely appalled by the programs that my son was put in. And I think that these type of programs have to be looked into, and also the social workers that do give these so-called classes, they should be checked and retrained and held accountable because there are programs. And so my local district one, Margaret Chin, my city council woman, she needs to know that ADA Canal Street, the whole building needs to be checked. It's called Red Core. It's just, they're not doing the right work there. I don't know why they are spending all the money.", "5754": "My son was mandated to be there, to go there every day. And it was mainly like a lot of people on methadone and not being checked. There was a lot of addicted people. And the way they check them is they would give them urine test, two, three times a week, which they make the lab rich. It sounded to me that it was a monstrosity of a moneymaking machine going on there, but not really help anyone, any specific person, rather than just create money and justify their jobs. That's how I look at that program there, that office, whatever that is. So there are some ... I hope that not all the programs are that way, but I'm shocked the way he would come home and tell me that the teacher or the social worker that was giving the class was a racist.", "5755": "And this is a black woman coming from Harlem who is laughing and kidding around about the Chinese, because she's now teaching in Chinatown. It's like these men don't need to be in a classroom, grown men who have addictions. My son didn't have an addition, so he didn't really belong there, but he had to do it. And they're just there. And instead of getting something positive out of a class, she's kidding around with all the other black folks about how they teach ... Whatever derogatory terms. My son is the type of person that doesn't really, he's got so much that he just shuts. He would shut down in a corner and not going to talk, and he's not going to interact with this. They would come home and horrified, and they had to listen to the whole, this thing about ... and this is the class that they're mandating me to, these unprofessional people pushing this kid around with us, like we are the buddies. And then they come up with derogatory terms. I don't want to hear that.", "5756": "And then he said, \"The frequency of the urine test was also exaggerated.\" And I'm thinking, and they get the results quickly, within the week they got results. Wow. I even said, \"I wonder which lab they use, this lab is going to be happy. They're making money. These are corporation making money behind all of this.\" We need to put professionals that run this thing better. They need to be checked. They need to be made accountable. They need to be really there to help people, people with addiction. Because in that case, there was a lot of addicted people. But even people like my son who came out of prison and is now thrown with these addicted people, in an addiction program where he doesn't belong, put him in another kind of program. He needs other kinds of help, but not addiction help.", "5757": "And on top of that, he's watching these things, and everyday coming back with some stories from over there. And he said to me, this is ... it's even worse than being in prison, because now I am thrown into a room with people with also some addictions. And I'm the only one who's doesn't have it. And they know, so they were trying to use him as the example of how the program works well. No, the program doesn't work well because you didn't fix him from addictions, because he came in without one. And then I even called parole officer above ... I forgot, the guy even above the parole officers or people live, I was asking, \"Why would my son be in the program? He needs something else. Maybe he could use anger management or he could use other types of mental help.\" And they will tell me, \"Oh yeah, because in his file he was using marijuana.\" Marijuana now, his file he was using marijuana before he got arrested. We're talking about 10 years ago.", "5758": "How could he be using marijuana if he was just locked up all these years, and he doesn't have any record of smoking marijuana up to yesterday. That was like something that's written prior to being incarcerated, because of that you put him in an addiction program. So the whole thing is ... something is wrong. Okay. Let's say they made a mistake. They put him in the addiction program, fine. But at least put proper social worker, put professionals running it.", "5759": "Anna, yeah. I'm sorry, we're past time, so [crosstalk 01:27:20].", "5760": "They need to be checked and made accountable, all of these programs.", "5761": "Yeah. Got it. Anyone else? Any final thoughts to add, just what you want the officials to know before we close out?", "5762": "I'll be real quick. Stop using band-aids to fix problems. I've said this a thousand times to all the council members and the mayor, please stop doing that. Invest in holistic culture responsive and trauma informed services. And I think I'll just ... and I think lastly is, justice impacted people and communities have the answers. A lot of them we've already provided to you, but we are more than willing to keep providing them to you to make sure that it works. So please come to us and include us in these conversations to actually reach the goal we want to reach.", "5763": "Thank you.", "5764": "I think very well said. I would just echo the message of increased funding for mental health. And I think your point about, it's best practice anywhere when you do international development work as well to connect with the community that you're trying to serve and see how they want to be served. Don't pretend that you can guess their needs, ask them, and involve them.", "5765": "Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. This has been a really rich conversation. You all have given us so much to think about, and also so much information and ideas to take back to the department of health through this conversation, so that they can begin to really center the experiences directly impacted people much more often. Thank you for all your contributions. [inaudible] has a quick little, I think survey, that is going to pop into the chat. I think that's what's happening or a poll. I don't know. I think he's going to do that now. Oh, there's a survey link. We just would love your feedback, so we close this out. And if you have any other questions or thoughts after this, feel free to reach out to us. But we really appreciate you taking the time on this Tuesday evening to be with us and to share and make these contributions."}, "no_stops": {"0": "welcom convers cortico' local voic network new york

estoy ahorita todav\u00eda tratando de pensar porqu ser\u00eda pued ser que la reunion ahorita de zoom la educaci\u00f3n que ahorita estamo d\u00e1ndole uso la tecnolog\u00eda eso s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 otra cosa ser\u00eda la verdad que es muy dif\u00edcil estoy pensando todav\u00eda s\u00e9 lo mejor que la compa\u00f1era tienen un poquito m\u00e1 tiempo de pensar pero es bien dif\u00edcil la verdad es bien dif\u00edcil porqu toda la familia est\u00e1n en casa sabemo muy bien que vivimo en lugar muy reducido toda la familia est\u00e1 adentro pue tenemo espacio como para ir sentarno tener un jard\u00edn tal vez pensar reflexionar pero ahorita solament yo creo que es la tecnolog\u00eda ver tanta noticia escuchar m\u00e1 audio tal vez un poquito m\u00e1 de m\u00fasica eso es lo que yo pienso", "426": "gracia marta estoy de acuerdo totalment s\u00e9 olvid\u00f3 contestar la pregunta risa m\u00ed tambi\u00e9n la quiero contestar si quier a\u00f1adir algo marta en el transcurso de cuando otra est\u00e9 participando por favor cuando t\u00fa quiera algo que est\u00e1 funcionando en mi comunidad para apoyar mi salud bienestar estoy de acuerdo con marta en el sentido de que en esto tiempo mucho de pronto por todo lo que est\u00e1 pasando pero creo que para m\u00ed la identidad cultur de la comunidad de corona jackson height es algo que a\u00f1oro mucho por lo que yo crec\u00ed fuera de mi pa\u00ed aunqu nac\u00ed en mi pa\u00ed por mucho a\u00f1o viv\u00ed ah\u00ed nac\u00ed en mi pa\u00ed viv\u00ed por alguno a\u00f1o vivido mucho a\u00f1o en nueva york siempr tenido ese conflicto de identidad que s\u00e9 si comparten conmigo de pronto su hijo que han nacido aqu\u00ed siento que part de mi est\u00e1 en colombia de dond yo soy part de m\u00ed es de aqu\u00ed vece da mucha nostalgia de poder ir visitar mi pa\u00ed mi familia que est\u00e1 all\u00e1 algo que ha funcionado que ayuda digamo en sentirm tan trist de poder estar en mi pa\u00ed es cuando paso por jackson height veo la panader\u00eda colombiana veo la persona hablando espa\u00f1ol compartiendo un almuerzo viendo un partido de f\u00fatbol que el vecino est\u00e9 habl\u00e1ndol otro vecino el vecino est\u00e1 vendiendo salchipapa arepa siento un sentido de comunidad siento como que estoy tan lejo de mi cultura estoy tan lejo que puedo tener aunqu sea un poquitico de mi cultura aqu\u00ed tambi\u00e9n la cosa que han contribuido siento que mi comunidad pesar de lo que sea no cuidamo el uno al otro si estoy en un problema si siento trist inclus si algo falta yo crec\u00ed con una madr soltera dond hubo mucho momento dif\u00edcil financierament de otra cosa su c\u00edrculo de comunidad que se ha convertido en el m\u00edo nunca no dej\u00f3 siento que aunqu de pronto el sistema gubernament lo que sea estuvo ah\u00ed siempr para apoyarno siento que la comunidad el sentido de familia aqu\u00ed con persona que son familia de sangr pero que se convirtieron as\u00ed en lo momento m\u00e1 dif\u00edcil siempr han estado ah\u00ed entonc eso s\u00ed lo tengo que atribuir mi comunidad hablo de mi comunidad de corona porqu yo crec\u00ed mi ni\u00f1ez fue en esa comunidad quiero resaltar esa part marta", "427": "s\u00ed lo que s\u00ed visto que ha funcionado en mi comunidad la verdad que s\u00ed son lo grupo la coalicion organizacion equipo eso s\u00ed eso s\u00ed es algo muy bueno porqu la coalicion lo grupo la organizacion hasta el momento son ello lo que han estado apoyando la comunidad eso solament", "428": "gracia marta \u00bf gladi voy hacer la pregunta otra vez para la que de pronto escucharon la primera vez \u00bf qu\u00e9 es lo que est\u00e1 funcionando bien en su comunidad para apoyar su salud bienestar \u00bf cu\u00e1l son la persona lugar cosa que han contribuido su salud bienestar positivament en su comunidad \u00bf gladi", "429": "okay para m\u00ed yo creo que lo que est\u00e1 funcionando para mejorar la salud ha sido la relaci\u00f3n de lo servicio m\u00faltipl que han tenido toda la organizacion como por ejemplo elmhurst commun partnership toda la organizacion en conjunto han sido un punto fundament para toda la comunidad en gener lo servicio de salud lo servicio de food pantri lo servicio de asesor\u00eda legal todo eso gratuitament tambi\u00e9n la ayuda para la persona que han estado enferma ayuda para la persona que han fallecido eso ha hecho de que esta comunidad pueda estar organizada en s\u00ed porqu si hubieran existido esta comunidad como la organizacion yo pienso que esto hubiera sido m\u00e1 complejo tambi\u00e9n considero que toda la persona que trabajan en lo que es trabajadora social han sido fundamental para que pueda salir adelant toda nuestra comunidad sobr todo aliviar la salud mental de la persona porqu eso ha hecho sentir la persona que est\u00e1n sola la llamada de tel\u00e9fono de toda la persona que hacemo en nuestra comunidad como el trabajo que estamo haciendo cada semana la organizaci\u00f3n en la escuela que fue inmediata para que lo alumno puedan tener su materi para estudiar remotament el idioma tambi\u00e9n porqu antiguament el idioma funcionaba para nadi uno le pod\u00edan estar abriendo el coraz\u00f3n pero el pacient sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 le iba hacer el m\u00e9dico dec\u00edan esto es unit state ust ten\u00eda que hablar ingl\u00e9 como sea le hac\u00edan lo que quer\u00edan en su cuerpo eso causaba tambi\u00e9n como una falta de identidad para la persona tambi\u00e9n frustraci\u00f3n pienso que ahora como es legal incluso para poder trabajar ya solo le piden el ingl\u00e9 sino se ha legalizado ya el idioma espa\u00f1ol en cualquier lugar ust pued hablar su idioma pued exigir legalment que le hablen su idioma porqu si le hablan su idioma est\u00e1n atropellando es tambi\u00e9n \u00bf c\u00f3mo le puedo decir es una discriminaci\u00f3n cuando le est\u00e1n hablando su idioma eso funciona porqu eso trae salud mental cuando uno est\u00e1 en una reuni\u00f3n entiend el idioma se va frustrado sient que estuvo perdiendo el tiempo en una reuni\u00f3n dond entendi\u00f3 nada eso es muy important porqu ahora la persona pueden ser aceptada incluso en trabajo por hablar el idioma espa\u00f1ol que deber\u00eda ser univers pue esa son mi idea mucha gracia", "430": "gracia gladi tien toda la raz\u00f3n \u00bf tania", "431": "lo que yo siento que ha ayudado en la comunidad bueno como dijo marta en esto momento es mucho pero lo que s\u00ed pienso que el saber que hay organizacion que est\u00e1n cuidando de todo lo de nuestra comunidad que ser\u00eda jackson height corona eso da un alivio tanto como person nivel de la comunidad el saber que hay persona que pesar que est\u00e1n exponiendo su propia vida para ayudar otra persona habla mucho de esa persona siento que ant de que pasara todo esto algo que m\u00ed ha ayudado en lo person es cuando uno llega del pa\u00ed de uno llega ac\u00e1 todo mundo la mayor\u00eda habla espa\u00f1ol eso uno le llena eso de saber de que pesar que estamo en estado unido podemo hablar nuestro propio idioma encontrar nuestra comida de ecuador colombia de m\u00e9xico es algo muy bonito estoy hablando en lo gener es lo que ser\u00eda queen", "432": "s\u00ed definitivament gracia tania \u00bf mayra", "433": "okay sin duda lo que hace sentir que mi comunidad est\u00e1 funcionando bien sin duda es la labor social que est\u00e1n haciendo la organizacion mucha persona que est\u00e1n haciendo voluntariado asamble\u00edsta persona que sin esperar nada cambio se preocupan por el bienestar del vecino de la vecina si se encuentra bien si tien pa\u00f1al uno de ello somo creo nosotro que no hemo estado preocupando por el bienestar de la dem\u00e1 persona de nuestro vecindario yo tambi\u00e9n sido una beneficiaria de eso con mi beb\u00e9 como yo tengo una bebita entonc eso parec que est\u00e1 funcionando muy bien en mi comunidad ahora de hecho que s\u00ed es impresionant vivir en un \u00e1rea como en dond yo vivo que es en jackson height porqu ac\u00e1 uno se sient como en casa lo que dicen mi compa\u00f1era es completament cierto si uno sale la esquina uno va encontrar un restaurant colombiano que hace cafecito uno se sient como gusto pero debo resaltar mucho la labor social que estamo haciendo todo en conjunto estamo demostrando que m\u00e1 que latino nosotro estamo todo junto en esto momento para apoyarno", "434": "claro que s\u00ed gracia mayra \u00bf esmeralda", "435": "bueno yo creo que en esto tiempo vuelvo la primera pregunta es la solidaridad que tenemo lo uno lo otro eso que no hacer ser diferent en jackson height elmhurst east elmhurst es que estamo ah\u00ed uno para lo otro aunqu tengamo lo suficient creo que compartimo lo poquito que tenemo hacia lo dem\u00e1 creo que ecp ha hecho un gran trabajo en esto momento dond la comunidad perdi\u00f3 trabajo perdi\u00f3 familia perdi\u00f3 mucha cosa pero tenemo esa solidaridad de estar unida toda trabajamo en equipo una por riesgo desd su casa otra saliendo ver c\u00f3mo est\u00e1 nuestra comunidad porqu aunqu hay mucha resiliencia entr nosotra hay momento que eso se baja \u00bf por qu\u00e9 porqu hay trabajo porqu nuestra familia necesitan comida porqu creo que lo primero mese ten\u00edamo la esperanza de que pasara r\u00e1pido ahora que han pasado lo mese vemo que es el momento en que m\u00e1 necesitamo de solidaridad de toda la organizacion de toda la persona que est\u00e1n ah\u00ed que creo que lo \u00fanico que podemo hacer es ayudarno mutuament estar ah\u00ed uno para lo otro al igual que mucha de usted yo tambi\u00e9n vien est pa\u00ed cuando ten\u00eda bueno yo vine m\u00e1 grand cuando ten\u00eda 13 a\u00f1o entrar una escuela hizo pasar por mucha cosa el primer a\u00f1o yo le dec\u00eda mi mam\u00e1 que ya yo quer\u00eda ir la escuela por el idioma mi mam\u00e1 se ten\u00eda que sentar conmigo traducir la tarea con un diccionario ella dec\u00eda que iba pasar que yo iba poder siempr ha estado ah\u00ed detr\u00e1 de m\u00ed mi mam\u00e1 creo que como latina eso es lo que somo la que tenemo hijo ahora estamo ah\u00ed detr\u00e1 de nuestro hijo para que ello sientan nuestro apoyo pero creo que en lo person lo que yo trato de demostrarl mi hijo ense\u00f1arl es que siempr volteen su alrededor ello tuvieron la bendici\u00f3n de nacer en est pa\u00ed hablan un ingl\u00e9 perfecto pero yo siempr le digo lo do m\u00e1 grand que son lo que ya tienen un poquito m\u00e1 de capacidad de entend que siempr que vean que alguien nuevo llega la escuela sean esa mano que alguna vez alguien fue conmigo esa mano de ayuda ello ahora le toca ayudar \u00bf por qu\u00e9 porqu llegan ni\u00f1o esa edad su escuela se tienen que adaptar un nuevo pa\u00ed un nuevo sistema un nuevo idioma una nueva escuela en nuestro pa\u00eds hay m\u00e1 libertad en la escuela aqu\u00ed es todo adentro todo en un build entonc creo que siempr le dicho mi hija especialment que sea esa mano esa mano que necesiten otro para caminar junto que sea esa part que tambi\u00e9n exist en est pa\u00ed que discrimina que se burla de ti porqu creo que si todo no unimo no apoyamo el mundo ser\u00e1 mejor siempr", "436": "claro que s\u00ed gracia esm \u00bf lucero \u00bf lucero", "437": "hola perd\u00f3n yo creo que lo mismo que dice esmeralda lo que est\u00e1 funcionando para mi salud mental es eso lo grupo de apoyo que con esa pandemia hemo aprendido como ayudarno uno con otro entonc eso no ha ense\u00f1ado ser m\u00e1 humano entr nosotro en que si yo tengo una informaci\u00f3n se la comparto otra persona as\u00ed como una cadenita as\u00ed no vamo ayudando mutuament como dijo martita tambi\u00e9n la tecnolog\u00eda ha hecho mucho para que nosotro tambi\u00e9n tengamo ayuda mano llena l\u00f3gico ecp elmhurst commun partnership ha sido una part fundament para nuestra comunidad de hecho ayer est\u00e1bamo trabajando en la fue nuestro \u00faltimo d\u00eda en la iglesia yo sent\u00ed hermoso yo soy muy cursi ya sabe risa llegaron do madr de familia se acercaron j\u00e9ssica m\u00ed no dijeron que si no pod\u00edan tomar una foto que porqu ella

entonc creo que hemo aprendido eso ser m\u00e1 humano ayudarno entr nosotro como dijo esmeralda ya eso es todo", "438": "gracia lucero la \u00faltima pregunta ant de terminar nuestra conversaci\u00f3n por hoy que puse tambi\u00e9n ah\u00ed es \u00bf qu\u00e9 hemo aprendido creo que varia lo contestamo de una u otra manera pero \u00bf qu\u00e9 hemo aprendido sobr el bienestar la resiliencia de nuestra comunidad en esta pandemia que te gustar\u00eda que otro entiendan pued compartir por medio de una historia de tu experiencia para poder ayudarno entend mejor ya pueden contestar esto vamo tratar de hacerlo en meno de un minuto pero creo que cada una de usted lo contestaron muy bien lo que aprendido del bienestar la resiliencia de mi comunidad es que somo gent luchadora no damo por vencido creo que esta pandemia fue muy dif\u00edcil realment ha sido una etapa muy dif\u00edcil para nuestra gent trabajadora que se han quedado sin trabajo hay escuela f\u00edsica que eso de una u otra manera s\u00ed afecta poder tener la capacidad la dignidad de ir hacer nuestra propia compra que eso tambi\u00e9n no afecta el bienestar tanta cosa que han afectado esta pandemia pero fuera de eso fuera de todo eso nuestra comunidad sigu luchando sigu hacia delant sigu camellando todo lo d\u00eda la vemo activa por lo meno en corona en jackson height se han dado por vencido nosotro si tenemo que aru\u00f1ar la tierra lo haremo si tenemo que hacer lo tengamo que hacer somo muy recursivo somo muy innovador vece no damo ese cr\u00e9dito somo muy echado para adelant en el sentido de que podemo solucionar r\u00e1pido si tenemo que vender algo lo hacemo si tenemo que crear algo lo hacemo si tenemo que juntarno asociarno con alguien para crear algo ayudarno mutuament lo hacemo aprendido eso acerca de nuestra comunidad s\u00ed el bienestar de nuestra comunidad ha sido afectado es important hablarlo reconocerlo tenemo que hablar de la salud mental ha sido afectada nuestra comunidad lastimosament tenemo que trabajar en pro de eso de volver levantarno estar ah\u00ed el uno por el otro que lo hemo estado haciendo pesar de la necesidad que tenemo porqu cada uno ha sido afectado de una u otra manera seguimo ayudando al vecino seguimo ayud\u00e1ndono mutuament pesar de que estamo en necesidad que es algo maravilloso que muestra como dec\u00eda esmeralda la solidaridad de nuestra comunidad entonc eso comparto \u00bf marta", "439": "s\u00ed yo por ejemplo escog\u00ed la palabra poder porqu vece poder se dice es yo soy primero se dice tengo mucho poder soy valient todo pero gusta much\u00edsimo una frase que dice el poder se vuelv virtud cuando lo pone al servicio de lo dem\u00e1 entonc eso es el poder nuestra comunidad tien vece sabemo pero tenemo mucho poder cuando no unimo vece uno quisiera llegar todo pero vece podemo s\u00ed hay familia que tal vez tiraron la toalla porqu s\u00ed hay \u00bf qu\u00e9 otra cosa soy muy sensibl pero como toda la compa\u00f1era dicen hemo aprendido para nosotro nunca ha sido nada f\u00e1cil entonc un viru no va tirar al contrario sabemo que nuestra comunidad fue la m\u00e1 golpeada pero aqu\u00ed estamo es f\u00e1cil porqu escuchado historia de que tal vez la familia quier salir adelant hacer su actividad est\u00e1 la polic\u00eda le pone ticket entonc ha sido un poco dif\u00edcil pero somo fuert estamo aqu\u00ed saliendo adelant", "440": "eso s\u00ed gracia marta \u00bf gladi", "441": "okay gracia marta por ser fuert llorar porqu la persona que lloran demuestran fortaleza quiero respond la pregunta yo aprendido la resistencia aprendido luchar pelear en forma organizada ver que hay que seguir la regla porqu si seguimo la regla se pued trabajar en comunidad aprendido que como mam\u00e1 tenemo que poner el hombro para que esto salga adelant tenemo que tenerl miedo la cosa que vienen aprendido que dio tien el control de todo esto que nosotro tenemo que irno para atr\u00e1 sino ir para adelant dar la cara para todo lo que venga como por ejemplo est reto que fue el corona yo digo que fue el corona porqu ya lo estamo ganando eso con toda la tecnolog\u00eda que exist\u00eda en lo tiempo pasado ha venido ahora salvar la vida de la persona porqu la medicina antigua son lo que realment han salvado la gent para m\u00ed mucha gent que ha estado en la casa se ha curado mucha gent que ha ido al hospit ha muerto entonc hay que tener fe en lo conocimiento que ten\u00edan nuestro padr nuestro ancestro tambi\u00e9n aprendido que el tiempo que nosotro podemo dar tien mucho valor porqu hay mucha gent que te llama te pide una ayuda en un tiempo que es seg\u00fan el tiempo pero uno ya pone tiempo eso cuando la cosa pasan porqu interesa es un tiempo voluntario que t\u00fa tien que darlo que lo da con amor porqu as\u00ed podemo ayudar mucha gent aprendido que se pued hacer un plato de comida m\u00e1 para darl un vecino para darl un amigo para darl al que realment lo necesita que eso te llena el coraz\u00f3n que est\u00e1 haciendo algo bueno positivo por la gent por nuestra comunidad que lo necesita todo eso aprendido mucho ser m\u00e1 solidaria con todo ser humild que lo de afuera interesa sino lo que tien uno adentro en el coraz\u00f3n gracia", "442": "gracia gladi \u00bf tania", "443": "bueno yo voy tomar un poco de lo que la tre dijeron s\u00ed nuestra comunidad es muy luchadora siempr est\u00e1 buscando la manera de salir adelant hay gent que se ha quedado sin trabajo se queda en la casa empieza hacer pan empiezan invitar lo amigo estoy vendiendo pan as\u00ed se ganan su d\u00eda d\u00eda aunqu sea 20 d\u00f3lare al d\u00eda eso es para darl de comer su hijo porqu hay vece en que sabemo la situaci\u00f3n de nuestro vecino entonc esta pandemia tambi\u00e9n no ha ayudado hacer eso estar m\u00e1 pendient de nuestro alrededor de la persona que tenemo al lado lo que tal vez nunca le dijimo hola ahora le estamo viendo si est\u00e1 bien si necesita algo si podemo ayudar en algo entonc yo pienso que esta comunidad es muy unida pesar de que hay alguna temporada que hay conflicto pero yo pienso que en gener somo unido siempr estamo viendo por el otro", "444": "definitivament gracia tania \u00bf mayra", "445": "perd\u00f3n yo creo que sin duda lo tiempo que estamo pasando son muy complicado pero si algo tengo que decir de mi comunidad de la vivencia que yo tenido es que definitivament somo uno guerrero como han dicho nuestra compa\u00f1era anteriorment estamo viendo persona que se est\u00e1n como decimo en per\u00fa recurseando como sea est\u00e1n haciendo comidita est\u00e1n haciendo la mascarilla ah\u00ed tengo el caso conozco una persona que lo est\u00e1 haciendo de manera gratuita para ayudar la comunidad entonc el valor que yo dije el de la solidaridad creo que es algo que nosotro esta pandemia no ha hecho aprend definitivament creo que toda la persona todo lo vecino toda la persona que podemo darno una manito siempr vamo estar ah\u00ed para hacerlo porqu eso es lo que no identifica como latino como hispano siempr vamo tener as\u00ed yo siempr dicho que el que meno tien es el que m\u00e1 da porqu vece hay persona que tienen mucho pero que son ego\u00edsta el que meno tien se preocupa m\u00e1 por ayudar la persona vamo hacer esto estamo mirando mucho caso dentro de nuestra comunidad hay persona que han tenido p\u00e9rdida de familiar eso lo ha impulsado para ser voluntaria para poder ayudar otra persona la capitana del equipo de brooklyn en lo que nosotro estamo trabajando en el censo ella perdi\u00f3 su mam\u00e1 ella sin embargo ella se recuper\u00f3 dijo yo tengo que ayudar mi comunidad porqu solament soy yo sino somo todo lo que estamo perdiendo familia estamo perdiendo persona important en nuestra vida se miran caso tan terribl tan trist que hay persona que pueden ni siquiera encontrar su muerto entonc la solidaridad parec que esa es la palabra clave del aprendizaj que nosotro hemo tenido ahora en esto tiempo dif\u00edcil de pandemia mucha gracia", "446": "gracia mayra esmeralda", "447": "bueno pue yo creo que en esta pandemia aprendido mucho al principio cuando un\u00ed risa ecp trabajar pens\u00e9 que \u00edbamo planificar evento nunca imagin\u00e9 que lo primero que fu\u00e9ramo planificar fuera un food pantri dond pudi\u00e9ramo ayudar aprendido mucho tanto de

tocara un n\u00famero quedara sin alimento escuchado mam\u00e1 decir gracia porqu hoy mi hijo pudieron comer eso es en lo person muy satisfactorio por el hecho de decir pudimo hacerlo sino por el
